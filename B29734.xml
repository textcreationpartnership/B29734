            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE <hi>Country Conformist in his Reflections on Dr.</hi> Stillingfleet'<hi>s Book of the Ʋnreasonableness of</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reflections.</hi> p. 22.</note>
               <hi>Separation,</hi> endeavours to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> from intending the Dean of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> in that lewd Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter he gave of <hi>a most unskilful, proud, partial, obstinate, cruel, impertinent Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary,</hi> by making it <hi>the description of such Substitutes, as had neither the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor nor Learning of the Doctor:</hi> However any impartial Reader will see cause to believe, that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> had the Dean in his Eye, tho he had not courage to apply every thing to him, but left his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to apply as much as they pleased.</p>
            <p>But suppose he meant this, <hi>of such Substitutes, as had neither the Candor nor Learning of the Doctor,</hi> I reckon a Man may fall many Degrees short of the Doctor, and yet not deserve such a
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:204354:4"/> Character, nor be unworthy of Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s notice. As for the former I confess, a very great proportion of that is necessary for any Man, who will treat Mr. <hi>B.</hi> with any tolerable Civility, when in all his late Writings he casts so much Dirt upon the Church and Church-men; and this Author will not allow the Dean him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self any great share of that, tho he has only very sparingly, considering the frequent Provocations, and very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently and modestly, considering the occasions he takes for it, rebuked that huffing Disputant. As for the latter, I acknowledg my self to be such a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute, as have not the Learning of the Doctor; and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> might well guess, that if he had any Substitutes at all, it was very likely he would have such Men: but yet a Man, who has not the Dean's Learning, having the advantage of the Ground he has gained, may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily defend it.</p>
            <p>When I sirst undertook this Defence, I designed no more than a short Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke to some such skulking Pamphle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers, as this <hi>Country Conformist,</hi> who do not fight with Mens Books, but with their Reputations; and have no other way of answering Arguments, but
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:204354:4"/> by picking up some By-Sayings, which with the help of an ingenious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may expose the Author, and then there is no need of answering his Book.</p>
            <p>For this Reason I began with <hi>the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest and peaceable Inquiry,</hi> which, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> tells us, was writ by Mr. <hi>Lob.</hi> Then Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s <hi>search for the English Schismatick</hi> fell in my way, which I could not avoid considering, because I had a great mind to know him; and here I found, how necessary it was to state the true Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Church-Union, which drew me on to answer so much of Dr. <hi>Owen</hi>'s <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into the Original of Evangelical Churches;</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Second true defence of the meer Non-Conformists in Answer to Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> as fell with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that compass, which are the most material things, they say; and thus I fortook my first Design, which therefore I must briefly reassume in this Preface, having not time now for such a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Examination of these things, as I intended.</p>
            <p>I shall begin with the Reflecter, who writes himself <hi>a Conformist Minister in the Country;</hi> and this is the only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable thing in it, that it is the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:204354:5"/> of one of our own Church, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Dean of St <hi>Paul</hi>'s, and for his Adversaries; and for that Reason Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> at the end of his Answer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers his Readers to him, that those <hi>may receive that from a Conformist, which they will not receive from such a one as he.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what is this to the purpose? If there be some such Conformists among us now, as there were in 1643, who raised a Civil War, and pulled down Church and State to set up a Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Parity, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> assures us, that <hi>most of the Assembly of Divines were Conformists,</hi> and yet blessed Reformers. And such a Conformist our Reflecter is, who vindicates Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Parochial Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, which is nothing else but a new <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reflections</hi> p. 7.</note> Name for Presbytery, as I have proved in the following Treatise. All the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is, that they are willing to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that Antichristian Office of <hi>Episcopi Episcoporum,</hi> to set a Bishop over Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, which Primitive Antiquity was a Stranger to; and St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> expresly condemns, and of which the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> is the only great and perfect Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
            <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:204354:5"/>
            <p>Nay our Conformist does plainly deride the Dean, for thinking he can justify our present Episcopacy. <hi>But the Doctor makes no question, but he shall</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 6.</note>
               <hi>confute this fanciful Man, and make it appear, that our present Episcopacy (which Mr.</hi> B. <hi>opposes) is agreeable to the Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Christ, and the best and most flourishing Churches; and easily he may, if Mr.</hi> B. <hi>be such a pitiful Antagonist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He pleads for taking off the Imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <note place="margin">P. 29.</note> (in general without any limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) to receive the Presbyterians again into our Church, which before he told us, <hi>were Subscriptions, Declarations,</hi> &amp;c. <note place="margin">P. 17.</note>
               <hi>and some few alterations besides:</hi> that is either a Form of Prayer, or at least our present Liturgy, Ceremonies, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of Religious Offices. Now he is an admirable Conformist indeed, who at once grants away the Episcopal Office, and instead of it, sets up a Bishop in every Parish, and either an Atichristian Bishop of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, or an Ecclesiastical Minister of State, to head and govern them; and alters the whole frame of our Worship, and into the Bargain leaves every Man to do as he lists, and all this without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring our present Constitution: Nay
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:204354:6"/> he concludes, <hi>That all those that hinder</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ib.</hi> p. 29.</note>
               <hi>the Ʋnion of Presbyterians with this Church, by continuing the Impositions, are Factors for the Pope, tho possibly they may do it ignorantly, at least many of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He pleads for the Indulgence of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <note place="margin">P. 17.</note> particularly the Independents, <hi>who,</hi> he says, <hi>will be satisfied with their own Congregations,</hi> and is mightily taken with Mr. <hi>Humphry</hi>'s Project (for so Mr. <hi>B.</hi> has taught us to call the Author of the peaceable Design) <hi>that the tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Churches</hi> (such as Independents) <note place="margin">P. 34.</note>
               <hi>be declared parts of the National Church, whereof the King to be the Head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He will not indeed allow of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Toleration, tho other Sectaries make equal pretences to Conscience, and have the same Pleas for Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence: <hi>But what then?</hi> (says our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formist) <hi>must all be equally indulged, or equally refused? A Man would think by this kind of arguing, that there are some besides the Non-Conformists, that are not the wisest Men in the World;</hi> Yes, Sir, no doubt, some such <hi>Country-Conformists.</hi> But in the mean time, how does he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the Dean's Argument, that it is not the way to Peace and Union, and
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:204354:6"/> to silence Differences. <hi>For upon the Principles laid down by some of our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting Brethren, let the Constitution be made never so easy to themselves, yet others may make use of their Grounds, and carry on the Differences as high as ever; which will render all attempts of Ʋnion vain, and leave the same Weapons ready to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up by others.</hi> The Dean says no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of tolerating one or other, but shews how unlikely it is, if Dissenters pursue those Principles, which they plead for their Separation now, ever to settle the Church in Peace, how ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy soever the Constitution be made: our Conformist answers, <hi>he hopes, the Governours will be able to distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt those that subvert the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and deny the Faith, and those that err in small things, and such as are consistent with Salvation; and that tho they may urge the same Arguments for their Liberty with better Men, yet they shall not have the same Concessions.</hi> Thus our Governours have already distinguish'd, and yet it has not put an end to our Controversies; and if they should distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish once more, is he sure, that will do? Will not the excluded Parties cry as loud for Liberty of Conscience, and
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:204354:7"/> complain of Persecution, as they do now? Either these are good Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or they are not; if they be, they will hold good in all Cases, that Men must not suffer for their Consciences, but be allowed the free exercise of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion according to their own Perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; if they be not, let them leave off the pretences of Scruples, and tender Consciences, with that Liberty and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in exercising their Religion, which they challenge as their natural Birth-Right, and demand no more of that than what the merit of their Cause re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires. As for what he adds about the Difference between subverting Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and some smaller Errors, as a just Foundation for Liberty or Restraint; Suppose our Governours should think Schism as destructive to Religion, and the Souls of Men, as many Heresies are, it would be an unreasonable thing to desire them to establish Schism by a Law, and yet if they did think so, they would not be much mistaken in it.</p>
            <p>This is sufficient to satisfy any Man, what an admirable Conformist this is, who is either grosly ignorant of the Constitution of our Church, or a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:204354:7"/> Enemy to it. And now no Man will wonder to observe his great parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality to Dissenters, and the different Judgment he passes upon the Dean and his Adversaries; where, if there be any difference in their Cause, the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage is plainly on the Dean's side. The whole design of this Pamphlet, being to charge him with Pride and Haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, with severe and unjust Reflections upon Dissenters; and to Apologize for their rude and barbarous way of treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so excellent a Person without any other Provocation, than a quiet and calm Discussion of the Principles of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.</p>
            <p>The only thing he can fix on in the Dean's Sermon, <hi>as raking into old Sores,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 15.</note>
               <hi>or looking back to the proceedings of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times,</hi> is one Passage, which was alledged by him as <hi>argumentum ad homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, That they would not condemn others, for that which themselves have practised, and think to be lawful in their own Cases.</hi> And instances, <hi>in those out-crys against the Church of</hi> England, <hi>as Cruel and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical, for expecting and requiring Ʋ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niformity; and yet do not such Men even at this day contend for the Obligation of a Covenant, which binds Men to endeavour
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:204354:8"/> after Ʋniformity in Doctrine, Discipline, and Worship?</hi> This I hope is not to rake into old Sores, when he appeals to their present Judgment and Practice, for which he need go no further than Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s <hi>Plea for Peace.</hi> But he adds, <hi>They want the Ingenuity of</hi> Adonibezek, <hi>to reflect on the Thumbs and Toes, which they have cut off from others, and think themselves bound to do it again, if it were in their Power: This</hi> (our Conformist tells us) <hi>in my Opinion is raking into old Sores, and looking back to the proceedings of former times.</hi> How tender are some Men! How often might I have read these Words, without taking them to be a History of former Times; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in no things that were done, no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that did them, are once mentioned? And may we not desire Men to reflect upon what is past, to make them modest in their censures of present Affairs, without being thought to rake into old Sores? I would desire this Author ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly to tell me, what he thinks of Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Historical Accounts of those times, which the Dean must not name, as he finds them lately published in his <hi>Plea for Peace.</hi> But he adds, <hi>the Doctor is not satisfied with looking backward, but
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:204354:8"/> he will needs look forward too, and as if he were a searcher of Hearts, undertake to tell what some Men will do hereafter, if it happen to come into their Power.</hi> No, Sir, The Doctor pretends to no such Gift, he only concludes this from the Obligation of the Covenant, which they still plead for, which if it still ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige, obliges them to promote Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in Worship, Doctrine and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, which is nothing less than the Resurrection of the good Old Cause; and we have had sufficient Experience already to know what that means, without a Spirit of Prophecy.</p>
            <p>This is the sharpest Passage he can pick out of that Sermon, and what u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage hath the Dean met with upon so little Provocation! Let any Man who has the Curiofity, and can find any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting Entertainment in it, read over Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s, Mr. <hi>A</hi>'s, Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s Answers, to name no more, and he shall need no better Instructors in this Polemical Art. And yet when our Arbitrator comes to state the difference between them, he has an excuse at hand for Mr. B. <hi>I do confess he is a plain Man, and uses but</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 21.</note>
               <hi>little Ceremony or Courtship in his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; some Men have Humours and Ways
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:204354:9"/> of their own—which may be very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily conceded to them; but that he wrote his Book in a continued Fit of Anger, or that there are injurious, or spiteful Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in it, I do not believe, nor cannot find:</hi> (how blind Men are, when they will not see!) <hi>he hath a very quick and earnest temper of Mind, and his stile is very keen and pungent; but Spite and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger are other things, and such as I believe Mr.</hi> B. <hi>a Stranger to.</hi> But now if Men revile and reproach without Spite and Anger, as much as other Men can do with it: <hi>If a quick and earnest temper of Mind, and a keen and pungent stile,</hi> make a Man guilty of as unjust Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and opprobrious Reflections, as the most envenomed Spirit, what satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction is this to the injured Person? Or who but such a kind Apologist could find the difference? Thus he Complements Mr. <hi>Humphrey's, pays him his hearty Thanks for his judicious Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate; for besides, the Apology he hath made for himself, he hath done the learned</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 33.</note>
               <hi>Doctor and Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>a great deal of right, for he hath modestly and plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked the Pride and Haughtiness of the one, and given the other his due and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served Praise:</hi> His Rebukes, I confess,
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:204354:9"/> are plain enough, how modest let o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers judge by a perusal of some few of them.</p>
            <p>The Dean had called Mr. <hi>Alsop this learned Man,</hi> which was indeed, as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> says, <hi>Ironically</hi> spoken, and which he makes <hi>an Indication what estimation he hath of himself in his contempt of others.</hi> But why so? Cannot he rebuke the pertness and folly of a trifling Scribler, who understands little more than Quibbles or Jests, without having a mighty Opinion of himself? Is it possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make a more abusive Paraphrase upon such an Expression, than Mr. <hi>H.</hi> has done. <hi>It is all one in good earnest, as if he should more at large speak thus to his Readers; Readers, you may perhaps think that Mr.</hi> Alsop <hi>is a learned Man; but alass, what is he in comparison of me?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Answ. to Dr. <hi>Stil. p.</hi> 9.</note>
               <hi>I am the Man that have all Learning in me. 'Tis I have done such Feats, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally against the Papists.

<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:204354:10"/> as well as Protestant Dissenters?</p>
            <p>In the next Page, he quarrels with <note place="margin">P. 10.</note> the Dean for <hi>pitying</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> which he thus again expounds, that Mr. <hi>B. belike, is one scarce worthy of the Doctors Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, but fit for his Compassion:</hi> whereas the Doctor says no more, but <hi>that he pityed him to see him appear with so much Anger and Ʋnbecoming Passion:</hi> which I should never have suspected as a sign of Contempt, but as an Argument of a great Mind, and generous Inclination, even to a peevish Adversary. Upon this Mr. <hi>H.</hi> is in great Wrath, and says, <hi>he hopes the Doctor is not so elated, as he is idle:</hi> very plain &amp; modest still! Then he runs a Comparison between Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and the Dean, in defiance of the old Proverb: and thinks it no sign of Modesty in the Dean to compare with Mr. <hi>B. for a profound Divine (which one may think here he would be at) that he is one as well</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 11.</note>
               <hi>as others who may be willing to learn (or else he is sure he will have the more need to be taught) of that Man whom he pitties:</hi> That Mr. <hi>B.</hi> has as much posed the Doctor, <hi>as ever any Boy in the higher Form at School, was posed by his Master.</hi> And here he triumphs over the Dean, as a Man, who has read Books indeed,

               <hi>Person, if he had a faculty for beating out a Notion, so good as he has for Books, and negligence towards others, that endeavour it.</hi> Now how easy were it to make as insolent and haughty a Paraphrase for these Words, as he did for the Dean upon a much less Occasion? <hi>for it is all one in good earnest, as if he should more at large speak thus to his Readers:</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, see here, how ignorant this great Schollar is, when you take him out of his Books; he knows nothing at all of the skill of <hi>Notion making:</hi> But I am the Man, who have not read indeed so much as he, but know how to <hi>beat out a Notion better:</hi> I can invent middle ways, faster than such dull Men as he can understand them, I can find out a constitutive Regent Head of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> when this great Church-Man did not know there was any, I can tell how by the vertue of an Act of Parliament, to turn all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles in <hi>England</hi> into one National
<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:204354:11"/> Church; the truth is, I have found out a great many precious Notions, which never were in any Books before, and it is insufferable for a Man who can only read Books, or transcribe out of them, to neglect those who make them; <hi>and I do wonder</hi> (being so skilled in the art of reasoning my self) <hi>how a Man, whose parts are so great, should be so slender in his reasonings, and why he should undertake the resolution of such a</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 26.</note>
               <hi>point, as he is no Body at, at all;</hi> as he adds a little after. In another place he continues his Triumphs oversome pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Book-Notion he has found of the Dean's: <hi>That there is no necessity of a constitutive Head, because a National Consent makes a National Church,</hi> and talks it quite out of Countenance, and yet this Notion has been Fathered up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on very ancient Notion-makers, who understood the Trade before our <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-maker</hi> was born; but for all that, <hi>he pronounces it such a grave Nothing, such a speaking Nothing with Gravity, and</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 23.</note>
               <hi>pretence of being wiser than his Fellows, that if he do not come to be ashamed before Mr.</hi> B. <hi>has done with him, or has reason to be so, I will be exposed to shume my self for my speaking thus freely, plainly, and
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:204354:11"/> honestly, as another Person perhaps would not do.</hi> Well I have interposed for once between the Dean and Shame in this Controversy, and if he has any cause to be ashamed upon this Account, I will blush for him, and let Mr. <hi>H.</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to do his part honestly, as he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, if it fall to his share.</p>
            <p>This is the usage, which this great Man has met with from Mr. <hi>H.</hi> which our Country-Conformist calls <hi>a plain and modest Rebuke,</hi> and justifies it with equal Modesty in these Words; <hi>And truly a supercilious, haughty, Ironical</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reflections</hi> p. 36.</note>
               <hi>Contempt of worthy and good Men, is so ill favoured a thing, that nothing but plain and unpolished Words are fit to rebuke it, and such a plain Rebuke is much more Christian and worthy of Religion, than an insolent despising, and trampling upon ones Adversaries, which the Doctor doth too too frequently in his Book.</hi> This is a good requital from a Church-man, for all that Contempt and Odium the Dean has so generously exposed himself to in the Defence of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet after all, if these Accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be true, the Dean is very much to blame; and tho he has admirably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
<pb n="xx" facs="tcp:204354:12"/> the Church of <hi>England,</hi> yet has not consulted his own Innocency and Reputation; let us then briefly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine what the Particulars are, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these Accusations are grounded.</p>
            <p>And our Reflecter begins with the <note place="margin">P. 4.</note> Dean's <hi>pitying</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> the Instance pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by Mr. <hi>H.</hi> which has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready considered. The next is founded on these Words: <hi>But whither will not some Mens indiscreet Zeal, and some of their own Fancies carry them, especially after forty years prescription?</hi> Our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor says, <hi>these last Words look somewhat scornful and sarcastical: Mr.</hi> B. <hi>belike is a Man of some Zeal, but of very little Ʋnderstanding: he entertained some Fancies about forty years ago, concerning the unlawfulness of Diocesan Episcopacy, and believes them to this day upon Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription.</hi> But may not Men of very good Understandings, be in some cases transported with an indiscreet Zeal? Does not that deserve the name of an indiscreet Zeal, which so plainly tends to blast the honour of our Reformation and Martyred Bishops, which is the case the Dean mentions? May not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wise and great Men, have some pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Fancies of their own? Or can
<pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:204354:12"/> he tell of many great Men, who were wholly free from them? Why should it then be thought <hi>scornful or sarcastical</hi> to charge Mr. <hi>B.</hi> with it, especially when the matter of Fact is evident? Unless it be a reproach to Mr. <hi>B.</hi> to be thought a Man, and subject to the weaknesses and imperfections of human Nature.</p>
            <p>His next Accusation is grounded on these Words: <hi>Not long after the same</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 9.</note>
               <hi>Author</hi> (Mr. <hi>B.) sets forth another Book with this Title; [The true and only way of Concord of all the Christian Churches] as tho he had been Christ's Plenipotentiary upon Earth, and were to set the Terms of Peace and Concord amongst all Christians.</hi> (he says) <hi>These Words are very haughty and full of Contempt!</hi> That I cannot see, they seem to charge Mr. <hi>B.</hi> with a very good Opinion of his own Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance; and I Confess, I know no Man, who has more plaid the Dictator in Religion in this last Age, than Mr. <hi>B.</hi> has done, and it is fit that he should know that it is taken notice of, and that his bare Authority is not sufficient to pull down one Church, not to set up another.</p>
            <pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:204354:13"/>
            <p>
               <hi>But is Mr.</hi> B. <hi>the only Man, that has proposed his Judgment and Opinion for the healing the Breaches and uniting the Churches of Christendom? Have not the</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reflections Ib.</note>
               <hi>great Pacificators at home and abroad done the same thing? and were they ever derided under the Notion of Christs Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotentiaries? Cannot a Person offer his judgment in this Case, but it must be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained with scorn and derision, and he exposed as a vaporing Mountebank?</hi> I answer, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is the first and the only Man, that ever I heard of, that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to determine <hi>the true and only way of Concord;</hi> other learned and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Persons, have modestly offered their Opinion in this case, and have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposed as Arbitrators, but no Man ever before passed a final and decretory Sentence, Thus it must be, and it cannot be otherwise; which is to act like a <hi>Plenipotentiary,</hi> which was all the Dean said; <hi>a vapouring Mountebank</hi> is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecters, and I think is not the English of <hi>Plenipotentiary.</hi> But our Author proceeds.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Doctor adds, the Book is fraught</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
               <hi>with such impracticable Notions, and dividing Principles, as tho his whole design had been to prove that there is no
<pb n="xxiii" facs="tcp:204354:13"/> true way of Concord among Christians; for if there be no other than what he allows, all the Christian Churches in the World at this day are in a mighty mistake.</hi> What now is the fault of this, does this savour of Contempt and Scorn too? That I do not find he says; But only says, <hi>that the fundamental Principles of that Book are no other than the great Pacificators have laid down.</hi> I cannot stay now to dispute this point with him; but sure I am, I never found Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s fundamental Principles in a Pacificator yet. <hi>But the</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 10.</note>
               <hi>main Principles thereof are such, as are fitted for the attaining of as much Peace, as can reasonably be expected in this World:</hi> That is as much as can be desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but what is that Peace? <hi>Ʋnion in Practice and Judgment is an idle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation: Men will believe variously, and practise variously too.</hi> Now it is out, did not the Doctor say this, <hi>that the design seemed to be to prove that there is no true way of Concord among Christians.</hi> And this our Apologist confesses; for the true Concord of Churches is one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and that cannot be had, while Men <hi>believe variously and practise vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="xxiv" facs="tcp:204354:14"/>
            <p>
               <hi>But the Doctor adds. When I looked</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 11.</note>
               <hi>into these two Books, and saw the design of them, I was mightily concerned and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely surprized, that a Person of his Reputation for Piety, of his Age, and Experience in the World, and such a lover of Peace as he had always professed himself, and one who tells the World so often of his dying, and of the day of Judgment, should think of leaving two such Fire-brands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him.—</hi> Here our Reflecter villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nously perverts the Dean's design, and represents him <hi>as scoffing at Mr.</hi> B. <hi>for telling the World of his dying and the day of Judgment.</hi> I will not attempt to vindicate the Dean from this Slander, which is too gross and notorious to find credit amongst his greatest Enemies. But <hi>these Books are Firebrands,</hi> so the Dean says, <hi>will appear to one, who duely considers them;</hi> and I shall leave the Proof at present upon that Trial.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the Doctor will have Mr.</hi> B. <hi>resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved (or at least seem to be so) to leave his Life and Sting together in the Wounds of this Church: These,</hi> he says, <hi>are vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Words, and not becoming this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Person.</hi> But are they true or false? Is not this the natural Interpretation of his Actions? if it be, why should he
<pb n="xxv" facs="tcp:204354:14"/> not be told so, and admonished by his dying, and the day of Judgment, to have a care, lest what he leaves behind him may make great additions to his Account, when he is removed off this Stage, and no longer able to redress the Mischiefs, which he has occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned?</p>
            <p>This is sufficient to be returned in answer to our Conforming Reflecter; for what he discourses about the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonableness of the Dean's Sermon, is not worth considering; those who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it necessary to give some check to a growing and boisterous Schism, will believe the Sermon very seasonable, whatever the Time, Place, or Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory was; for necessity makes every thing seasonable, and if ever it was necessary to oppose Schism, it is at this Day. Those who are of our Author's Mind, that it is not necessary, that it is more desireable to try Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s way, will never think it seasonable: and as for that dispute about Mr. <hi>A.</hi> it is so fully answered by the Dean already, that I see no need of adding any thing more.</p>
            <p>As for Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi>'s Answer, I have considered the Argument of it in
<pb n="xxvi" facs="tcp:204354:15"/> the Body of my following Defence, and have now considered his civil usage of the Dean; and there is nothing more remains, than his Vindication of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with reference to the <hi>peaceable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign.</hi> The Dean charged him, that in <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Stil.</hi> Pref. p. 25.</note> the first Edition of that Tractate in 1675, he granted toleration to Papists, as well as other Dissenters; in a new Edition of it in 1680, he denies them the liberty of such Toleration, because they were Idolaters, and only allows them the private exercise of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. The reason of this Difference, the Dean supposes to be, that in 75, they were willing to consent to a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration, tho the Papists reaped the advantages of it, as well as themselves; but after the Plot was broke out, they thought it unseasonable to make such a Proposal: Does Mr. <hi>H.</hi> deny the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact? By no means, but owns it all. But answers four things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it is <hi>the Doctors mistake to lay a charge upon the Party; for it was drawn up by one Man, tho put out by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:</hi> But this is his Mistake, for the Doctor does not charge it upon the Party, but expresly owns, <hi>that some of the Presbyterians did not joyn with the
<pb n="xxvii" facs="tcp:204354:15"/> Papists for a general Toleration,</hi> and produces this Instance only to shew, <hi>that this honour doth not belong universal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to them.</hi> And yet it seems tho one Man drew it up, yet there were more than one consenting to the publishing of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He answers in short, for that this is the substance of it, that he would not justify Toleration without granting it to Papists, as well as other Dissenters. Which shews us what a blessed Doctrine Toleration is.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He says the reason of his altering that Passage in the second Edition, was, that some of his Brethren were offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at it. But how many these were, he doth not say; it is plain some of them were not, nor do we know the reason why others were offended, which pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly might be as much owing to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Scandal, as to private Dissatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. As much as they were offended at it, it was not altered till the second Impression five years after.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He will not own, that he has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered his Judgment in the second Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of his Book, from what it was the first: But People know not Mens Judgments but by their Words, and
<pb n="xxviii" facs="tcp:204354:16"/> the Words of his first and second Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on contain a very different and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sence, which should suppose some alteration of his Judgment. For these Words, <hi>Edit.</hi> 75. seem to differ from these <hi>Edit.</hi> 80.</p>

               <note place="margin">Answ. to Dr. <hi>Still. p.</hi> 7,</note>
               <hi>should be taken in regard to the tolerating the Papist only privately, as his meaning really was then, and is now but fuller ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed.</hi> We have no way to disprove him what his meaning was, but by his Words; and if they desired a publick Toleration for themselves, they did so for the Papists, who were <hi>to come under the like Toleration:</hi> And I think Mr. <hi>H.</hi> might as well have let it alone, unless he could have made a better Defence. And thus I dismiss him.</p>
            <p>It is time now to return to Mr. <hi>Lob's modest and peaceable Enquiry,</hi> a Title which I suppose he gave this Pamphlet by way of Prophecy; for though in it self considered, it is neither very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest, nor very peaceable, as you may see in my first Chapter, yet considering that rude and barbarous Usage the Dean has since met with from other Hands, I begin to think Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> a very cool and modest Adversary.</p>

<pb n="xxx" facs="tcp:204354:17"/> the Papists make of our Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the boisterous and furious <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Enquiry</hi> p. 4.</note> Zeal of our Dissenters against the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And to expose the Dean to popular Odium and Fury, he says <hi>it is evident, that the great end of his History, if not of the whole Book it self, is to represent dissenting Protestants to be but the Jesuits Instruments:</hi> Where, if by Instruments he means such as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signedly promote a Popish Interest, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more false; but if he means such as by unreasonable Divisions, and an intemperate Zeal, give Advantages to the Papists to promote their own Cause, the Dean I confess does say it, and proves it too; and that for no other end, that I can perceive, but to reduce our Dissenters to sober Thoughts, that they who express such an Abhorrence of, and Antipathy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Popery, may take heed, lest they themselves bring it in.</p>
            <p>The Dean does not charge the Men, but the Nature and Tendency of their Actions with this Design, which is not to revile their Persons, (as Mr. <hi>Lob,</hi> Dr. <hi>O.</hi> represent it) but to warn them; for I confess, I always made a great difference betwixt what Men did
<pb n="xxxi" facs="tcp:204354:17"/>
               <hi>knowingly, or being deluded,</hi> till Dr. <hi>O.</hi> tells us, that <hi>it is all one;</hi> and if it be <note place="margin">To the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der before the Inq. into the Orig. of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</note> so, I must have worse thoughts of our Dissenters upon this account, than ever I had yet. Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> says, That some have reported <hi>the Non-conformists, some of them at least, do receive or have received Mony from the Papists, to act their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and promote their Interest,</hi> which he calls <hi>a putid Calumny, a malicious Falshood, afrontless Lie;</hi> now I confess I never heard of this Story, and do verily believe it to be false, if it be as the Doctor represents it, but possibly he may be mistaken in the Report; for if this Mony was given only to keep up their Hearts, and encourage their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, without any formal Contract to promote the Popish Interest any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ways, this might be thought a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry useful Project: <hi>He avows, that never any Person in Authority, Dignity, or</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
               <hi>Power in the Nation, nor any that had any relation to publick Affairs, nor from them, Papist or Protestant, did once speak one Word to him, or advise with him, about any Indulgence or Toleration to be granted to Papists:</hi> But they might for all this do it about Toleration in general, and since he thought fit to take
<pb n="xxxii" facs="tcp:204354:18"/> notice of that scandalous Report about some <hi>Non-conformist</hi>'s receiving Mony, why doth he not as avowedly clear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from that too? I will only tell the Doctor, we live in a busy pragmatical Age, wherein Men meddle with such things, as do not concern them; and this makes some Men very inquisitive to know the reason, why a Fast was appointed by a certain Independent Pastor at that time on the Fifth of <hi>Nov.</hi> which we know is no Popish Festival.</p>
            <p>But to return to our Enquiry, Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> reduces the Dean's Reasons (as he calls them) <hi>to engage the Reader to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Dissenters are a People car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on the Popish Designs,</hi> to six Heads.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Dissenters have embraced the</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 3, 5.</note>
               <hi>Jesuits Principles about spiritual Prayer, and a more pure way of Worship.</hi> Now I have read over the Dean's Preface very carefully, and can find no such thing urged against our Dissenters. All that Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> founds this Accusation on is, that <note place="margin">p. 6.</note> the Dean says, <hi>it is not improbable that the Jesuits were the first setters up of spiritual Prayer in England.</hi> This is mighty falsly and imperfectly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented, and thefore it is necessary to acquaint my Reader with the true state
<pb n="xxxiii" facs="tcp:204354:18"/> of this Matter, which will prevent the trouble of this Dispute.</p>
            <p>The Dean says, that <hi>there are strong Probabilities, that the Jesuitical Party</hi>
               <note place="margin">Preface p. 11.</note>
               <hi>had a great influence on the very first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of the Separation</hi> from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Church of <hi>England:</hi> this I hope is no Charge against the Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but the Jesuits; this the Dean proves, because for several Years in Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, neither Papists nor Non-conformists made any Separation from the Church. But <hi>the more zealous Priests and Jesuits, fearing the Effect of such a Compliance, first drew off the secret Papists from all Conformity with our Church:</hi> and then attempted <hi>to draw off Protestants from the Communion of this Church too, under the pretence of greater Purity and Perfection.</hi> And one way they took to accomplish this, was by setting up the way of more spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Prayer, and greater Purity of Worship than is in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> which the Dean proves from very credible Testimonies concerning Persons so employed in Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s days; an account of which has been lately published, with great Authority in a little Pamphlet, called <hi>Foxes and
<pb n="xxxiv" facs="tcp:204354:19"/> Firebrands;</hi> so that <hi>de facto,</hi> the first Men, who cried down our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer as a dull, formal, super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious Worship, and nothing better than the Popish Mass-Book in <hi>English,</hi> and set up the way of spiritual, free, <hi>Extempore</hi> Prayer in the room of it, to draw People from our Churches, were Jesuits, who professed to do it with this Design, to cause a Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and did effect what they designed, and the Separation is still kept up upon these Pretences, as we see at this day. And if Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> would have said any thing to the purpose, he should have dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved these Stories, which he has not so much as mentioned in all his Pamphlet; and yet this is the only thing the Dean insists on, and confirms it with this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation; That this way of free spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 16.</note> Prayer in publick was never known in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> nor any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reformed Church before this time; and yet all that is passed over in si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
            <p>The Dean indeed adds, that <hi>there is no improbability in the thing, if we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
               <note place="margin">ib. p. 14, 15.</note>
               <hi>the Suitableness of these Pretences about spiritual Prayer to the Doctrine and
<pb n="xxxv" facs="tcp:204354:19"/> Practises of the Jesuits: For they are professed despisers of the Cathedral Service, and are excused from their Attendance on it by the Constitutions of their Order; and are great Admirers of spiritual Prayer, and an Enthusiastick way of preaching.</hi> Can Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> disprove this? no: But he says, (1.) <hi>The Jesuits are not for free</hi>
               <note place="margin">Inquiry p. 7.</note>
               <hi>Prayer in publick.</hi> What is that to the purpose? they will not allow <hi>publick free Prayer</hi> in their own Church, <hi>ergo,</hi> they did not set it up in ours; they will not suffer their Preachers to rail against the Mass-Book at <hi>Rome, ergo,</hi> they will not allow this neither at a Conventicle. When we say, that they brought in the use of <hi>Extempore</hi> Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in publick, we do not say, they did this, as a thing they thought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable in publick, but as an excellent Contrivance to break, and divide our Church; and they may easily be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed to do that in our Church, which they would not allow in their own.</p>
            <p>But he answers, (2.) <hi>That free Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is not the Jesuits Invention;</hi> or rather says, that the Dean suggests, <hi>that the Jesuits are for free Prayer in publick, and that free Prayer is the Jesuits Invention:</hi> whereas the Dean has not said any
<pb n="xxxvi" facs="tcp:204354:20"/> such thing, nor given the least Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of it; and yet he takes this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to slander the Dean <hi>with treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the holy Spirit at an indecent manner, by ascribing its work, namely spiritual Prayer, unto the Jesuits, as though such are the works of the Spirit, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be distinguished from the Invention of the Jesuit:</hi> But where does the Doctor do this? doth he speak at all of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Prayer under any other notion, than as it is opposed to a form of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? does he any where make free Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the first invention of Jesuits? If this free Prayer were the work of God's Spirit (which we are not concerned to dispute now) cannot we say, that the Jesuits brought free Prayer (which at best is fitter for our Closets, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Devotions) into publick Use with an ill Intent, without reproaching the Spirit of God; there are no such ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Slanders, as those which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten between Zeal and Ignorance.</p>
            <p>This is not to dispute, but to fence; not to answer Arguments, but to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to lose them by diverting to another Question. The Dean proves, that the Jesuits had a great hand in the first biginnings of our Separation, and
<pb n="xxxvii" facs="tcp:204354:20"/> that the way they took to effect this, was by crying down Forms of Prayer, especially the English Liturgy, as no better than the Popish Mass-Book, and by setting up spiritual or free Prayer as a more pure way of Worship; Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> take no notice at all of this, but fall a disputing about spiritual Prayer, what it is, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were the Jesuits Invention; and I shall leave them to dispute this by themselves, for the present Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy is not concerned in it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. According to his way of making Arguments for the Dean, he says his second Argument is, that <hi>the Dissenters</hi>
               <note place="margin">Inquiry p. 9.</note>
               <hi>have blasted the Reputation and Honour of the Reformation, which is the great thing the Jesuits would be at.</hi> Here e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing is misrepresented again; the Dean shows, how very advantageous it would be to the Popish Interest, <hi>to overthrow the Constitution of the Church of</hi> England; <hi>that nothing is more envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and maligned by the Papists than the Church of</hi> England; <hi>nothing they have more wished to see broken in pieces; nor have used more Arts or Instruments to destroy; that Protestant Bishops have been martyred by their means, who yet
<pb n="xxxviii" facs="tcp:204354:21"/> had the same Episcopacy, that is now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, and which some now are so busy in seeking to destroy, by publishing one Book after another, on purpose to represent it as unlawful and inconsistent with the Primitive Institution; is all this done for the honour of our Reformation? is this the way to preserve the Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion among us, to fill Men's minds with such prejudices against the first settlement of it?</hi> &amp;c. So that the Dean's Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is this: Our Dissenters in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the Constitution of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and in blasting the Credit of the Reformation, do that, which of all things the Papists desire to see done, as the most effectual way to introduce Popery among us; <hi>I do not say</hi> (as the Dean adds) <hi>such Men are set on by the Jesuits, but I say they do their Work as effectually as if they were.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> answers two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Papists do not so much</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 10.</note>
               <hi>envy and maligne the Episcopal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,—neither is it their Principle nor Interest to destroy it,</hi> which he attempts particularly to prove; and though it is a Matter capable of a very easy Proof, yet he goes so oddly about it, as would tempt a Man to deny it, to try
<pb n="xxxix" facs="tcp:204354:21"/> his skill in these matters. But I shall only shew how impertinent it is to the present Inquiry, and dismiss it.</p>
            <p>The Papists (he says) are no Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to Episcopacy, but what then? may not they desire the destruction of the Church of <hi>England?</hi> will he be so hardy as to prove, that the Papists do not design to overthrow the Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Church of <hi>England?</hi> The <hi>French</hi> King is no Enemy to Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, and therefore he has no design upon the Empire of <hi>Germany,</hi> nor the Kingdom of <hi>Spain.</hi> What pity is it, the <hi>French</hi> King had not employed Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> to satisfy his Neighbour Princes, that he could have no design against them, because he is no Enemy to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, for it is against his Principles and Interest, that Monarchy should be destroyed? and yet I suspect his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours would not have been thus satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, unless he could give them as plain a Demonstration, that it was neither his Principle nor Interest, to make himself an Universal Monarch. Thus it is neither the Principles nor Interest of the Jesuits to destroy Episcopacy (tho by the way they are none of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Admirers of Episcopacy) but I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="xl" facs="tcp:204354:22"/> Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> will not prove, that they have no mind to pull down a Protestant Episcopacy, and to set up a Popish Episcopacy in the room of it.</p>
            <p>The more they like Episcopacy in general, the more they dislike it in Protestants, as being the best constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Government, the most easily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended against their Arguments, and the greatest Security, and the most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable Bulwark of the Protestant Cause.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He answers, <hi>The Reputation of the first Reformation is not hereby blasted, nor are the first Reformers in the least re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, 1. <hi>The memory of these Worthies is precious unto the Dissenters, who can distinguish between their Episcopacy, and their Martyrdom, they not being martyred for Episcopacy, but for renouncing Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation,</hi> &amp;c. This is what I said, that the Papists are not against Episcopacy, but against a Protestant Episcopacy. And these Martyrs were Bishops as well as Reformers, and exercised the same Episcopal Power and Jurisdiction, which our Bishops do at this day: and if this Office were Antichristian, and
<pb n="xli" facs="tcp:204354:22"/> destructive of the Church-order of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Institution, as our Dissenters ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally say, and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to prove, then these Martyrs must be Antichristian Bishops, and yet their Memory precious to Dissenters, who now abhor the thoughts of such Antichristian Bishops. Thus I perceive Dissenters they are resolved to be, tho they must dissent from themselves, unless they like none but Martyr'd Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They honour Reformers for what they did do: <hi>It being a wonder, that in less than six Years time they should do more towards Reformation than all the Bishops in</hi> England <hi>besides have done in</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 13.</note>
               <hi>almost six-score Years; they went as far as possibly they could in that Juncture, and probably would have gone</hi> pari passu, <hi>with</hi> Luther, Calvin, <hi>&amp;c. had they Time and Opportunity.</hi> And yet after these good Words, what was it they did, which deserves so much Commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? <note place="margin">Original of Churches, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face <hi>p.</hi> 33.</note>
               <hi>The Reformation of Doctrine and Worship,</hi> says Dr. <hi>Owen.</hi> Doctrine I confess in something; but how is our Worship reformed, when there remains such Corruptions still, as make a Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration necessary? that is a wonderful
<pb n="xlii" facs="tcp:204354:23"/> Reformation of a Church indeed, that leaves it still so corrupt, that it is not fit for Christian Communion! some Imperfections and Defects in a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, are indeed tolerable in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and such Reformers may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve their just Praises notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which was the case of the first Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy in <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. Reign, which was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards more perfectly reformed; but when the very Foundations of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation are rotten and corrupt, it is no great Credit either to the Reformers or to the Reformation; when the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation consisted in an Antichristian Monarchy, a Popish Mass-book turned into <hi>English,</hi> Popish Ceremonies, and Humane Sacraments, and such kind of Popish Trumpery, as it is unlawful for a good Christian to submit to. And as for Mr. <hi>Lob</hi>'s Conjecture, that probably they would have gone on had they had time and opportunity; what probability is there of this, when Arch-Bishop <hi>Cran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er</hi> at his Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, owned himself Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and <hi>Ridley,</hi> owned himself Bishop of <hi>London?</hi> And at the second Reformation of the Liturgy, when they had opportunity enough, if they
<pb n="xliii" facs="tcp:204354:23"/> had intended any such thing, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected their Reformation with the most grave and deliberate Advice, having first consulted <hi>Bucer,</hi> and other foreign Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, they left Episcopacy, Liturgy, Ceremonies, much as we now have them; and Dr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> who suffered Martyrdom, declares that the whole Church Service was so perfected in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s second Liturgy, <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi>

            <p n="3">
               <pb n="xliv" facs="tcp:204354:24"/>3. Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> adds, That <hi>William Nix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in his Examination before the Bishop of</hi> London, <hi>An.</hi> 1567. <hi>Says, that</hi> Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley <hi>Bishop of</hi> London, <hi>and Dr.</hi> Taylor, <hi>did recant it</hi> (using the prescribed Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) <hi>at their death</hi> Ridley <hi>acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged his Fault to</hi> Hooper, <hi>and when</hi>

               <hi>they would have put on the same Apparel upon him, he said they were abominable, and too fond for a Vice in a Play.</hi> It is true, <hi>Nixon</hi> did say so, but what Proof is this? The Bishop immediately asked him, <hi>Where find you that in the Book of Letters of the Martyrs?</hi> to which <hi>Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi> replies, <hi>It may be shewed in the Monuments of the Church, that many which were burned in Q.</hi> Mary'<hi>s days, dyed for standing against Popery, as we now do.</hi> Which was no Answer to the Bishops Question, for indeed the Allegation was false. Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi>'s Judgment we have already heard, and the Story of B. <hi>Ridley,</hi> and B. <hi>Hooper,</hi> is too well known to be here repeated, and he who wants an account of it, may find it already in Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet.</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="4">4. He adds, <hi>That those very Persons, who were so zealous in Q.</hi> Elizabeth'<hi>s days for Episcopacy, were Persons of whom it is recorded, that in time of Persecution
<pb n="xlv" facs="tcp:204354:24"/> they were Men of the same Principles with Dissenters.</hi> But where is this recorded?

We have the same Records now, which they had then, and no such thing appears; and this Fiction is evidently confuted by the History of the Troubles of <hi>Francford,</hi> of which <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ib.</hi> p. 8. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> the Dean has given a brief Account.</p>
            <p n="5">5. He produces a Copy of a Letter from the Queen's Council to bespeak some favour to Dissenters in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Laws against them; but to what purpose I cannot tell. The Queen and her Council were willing to miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the execution of Laws against some Dissenters, who did not separate, but condemned Separation, &amp; punish'd the <hi>Brownists,</hi> as they declare in their complaint, to which this Letter was an answer; therefore our Dissenters, who <note place="margin">Part of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister. <hi>p.</hi> 128.</note> separate, do not blast the honour of the Reformation. However since this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="xlvi" facs="tcp:204354:25"/> is produced, I will give an answer to it, by transcribing part of Sir <hi>Francis Walsingham</hi>'s Letter, as I find it recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi>'s History of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi>'s History of the Reformation. <hi>Part. 2. lib. 3. p.</hi> 420.</note> where Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> also might have found, what he so injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously charges the Doctor with leaving out, had he taken as much care in searching for it, as he does to pick up all little Stories right or wrong to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perse deserving Men.</p>
            <p>The Letter is to give an account of the Rules her Majesty observed in her Proceedings in Ecclesiastical Causes, both against Papists, and Reformers, as they named themselves; concerning the latter the account is this:</p>
            <p>
               <q>For the other Party which have been offensive to the State, tho in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother degree, which named them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Reformers, and we commonly call Puritans; this hath been the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding towards them: A great while when they inveighed against such a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses in the Church, as Pluralities, Non-residence, and the like, their Zeal was not condemned, tho their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence was sometime censured. When they refused the use of some Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and Rites, as superstitious, they
<pb n="xlvii" facs="tcp:204354:25"/> were tolerated with much connivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and gentleness: yea, when they called in question the superiority of Bishops, and pretended to a Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy in the Church; yet their propositions were here considered, and by contrary Writings debated and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussed. Yet all this while it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that their course was dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and very popular; as because Papistry was odious, it was ever in their Mouths, that they sought to purge the Church from the Reliques of Papistry: A thing acceptable to the People, who love ever to run from one extream to another.</q>

            <p>
               <q>Because multitude of Rogues, and Poverty was an Eye-sore, and a dislike to every Man; therefore they put into Peoples Heads, that if Discipline were planted, there should be no Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabonds nor Beggars, a thing very plausible: and in like manner they promised the People many of the impossible Wonders of their Discipline; besides, they opened unto People a way to Government by their Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story and Presbytery: a thing tho in consequence no less prejudicial to the Liberties of private Men, than to the
<pb n="xlviii" facs="tcp:204354:26"/> Soveraignty of Princes; yet in first Shew very popular. Nevertheless, this, except it were in some few, that entred into extream Contempt, was born with, because they pretended in dutiful manner to make Propositions, and to leave it to the Providence of God, and the Authority of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But now of late years, when there issued from them that affirmed, The consent of the Magistrate was not to be attended; when under a pretence of a Confession to avoid Slander and Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, they combined themselves by <hi>Classes</hi> and <hi>Subscriptions;</hi> when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended into that vile and base means of defacing the Government of the Church by ridiculous Pasquils; when they began to make many Subjects in doubt to take Oaths, which is one of the fundamental parts of Justice in this Land, and in all places; when they begun both to vaunt of their strength, and number of their Partizans, and Followers, and to use Comminations that their Cause would prevail through Uproar and Violence, then it appeared to be no more Zeal, no more Conscience, but meer Faction
<pb n="xlix" facs="tcp:204354:26"/> and Division; and therefore tho the State were compelled to hold some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what a harder Hand to restrain them, than before; yet was it with as great Moderation, as the Peace of the State or Church could permit.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This I suppose is a sufficient answer to Mr. <hi>Lob.</hi> But since he has brought us thus far out of our way, before I return, I shall upon this occasion make some Reflections upon Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story <note place="margin">Second Defence of Non-Conf. <hi>chap. 4. p.</hi> 29.</note> of the case of the old Non-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists.</p>
            <p>The Dean had made it appear, that the old Non-Conformists condemned the Principles of Separation, if we may believe their own Words, quoted out of their own Writings: Mr. <hi>B.</hi> thinks to confute this by opposing that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count which was given of them, by Bishop <hi>Bancroft,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Heylen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(1.) Now in the first place, has the Dean cited their Words truly or not? If he has, and they practised differently from their Principles, all that can be made of it is, that they are self con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, as some Non-Conformists at this day are; which is no great Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of tender Consciences. And I think Mr. <hi>B.</hi> was more concerned than
<pb n="l" facs="tcp:204354:27"/> the Dean, to reconcile their Principles with their Practices, or to have shown, how Men might write against Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and yet practise it themselves, or at least to have concealed the inconsisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of their Practice with their avowed Principles; which had been more for his own, and their Reputation, than to have alledged himself as an Example of such Self-contradiction.</p>
            <p>But (2.) Wherein does this contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety appear, between the account Bishop <hi>Bancroft</hi> gives of the old Non-Conformists, and that which Dr. <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet</hi> gives? That, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> thinks, is very evident: for Bishop <hi>Bancroft</hi> in his dangerous Positions, saith, <hi>That in</hi> Scotland <hi>it hath wrought more mischief in</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 3.</note>
               <hi>thirty years, than the Pope of</hi> Rome <hi>had done before, I think in five hundred:</hi> But does he say, this mischief was Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration? otherwise he does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the Dean.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the second Book he taketh up what rash Words he could, from any indiscreet Men to make them odious:</hi> And does the Dean deny, that they used to talk and write Sedition, and Libel Church and State, or write holy Common-Wealths?</p>
            <pb n="li" facs="tcp:204354:27"/>
            <p>In the third he saith, <hi>That the first ten or eleven years of the Queen's Reign they so clamoured, &amp;c.</hi> (that is a very convenient, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if I am not mistaken) <hi>that they divided themselves from their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Congregations, and meeting in Houses, Woods, and Fields, kept there disorderly and unlawful Conventicles.</hi> But does the Dean deny or conceal <note place="margin">Ʋmeas. of Separ. <hi>p.</hi> 20. &amp;c.</note> this? Does he not expresly own, that at this time they were a running into Separation, and how this was stop'd by <hi>Beza</hi>'s Authority, who expresly condemned it. Does he alledg any of these Men at this time writing against Separation?</p>
            <p>But the Bishop adds, <hi>That they told the Parliament, that their Discipline was God's Order, and they must in Conscience speak for it: They erected a Presbytery at</hi> Wandsworth; <hi>drew up a Book of their Discipline; had their Classical, Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, Comitial Synods, and Government: That he gives an account of the resolves of their Synods about several parts of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and Government:</hi> All this I grant is true, and yet all this was without Separation; as is evident from this, that these Men were all this while Ministers of several Parish Churches, and when
<pb n="lii" facs="tcp:204354:28"/> a stop was put to that Separation, which at first began to break out, they resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to set up their Discipline as private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they could, without forsaking the Communion of the Church: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore formed themselves into Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, had their Classical and Provincial Synods, and as much as they could, exercised their Discipline in their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes, made their Church-Wardens their Elders, and accounted none of their Parishioners of their Church, but such as submitted to their Discipline. And I think, I need say no more to show, how Bishop <hi>Bancroft</hi>'s and Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s account of the Non-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists may be easily reconciled: and therefore their Judgment and Practice against Separation does still plainly condemn the present Separation.</p>
            <p>As for Mr. <hi>Rathband,</hi> I do not find the Dean at all insist on his Authority; but only refers to the Book published by him, containing an account of some Non-Conformists Judgments, in the point of Separation, written some years before: And if his Son thinks it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Reputation to his Father to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present him as a Schismatick; I know not how any Man is concerned in it.</p>
            <pb n="liii" facs="tcp:204354:28"/>
            <p>Having returned this short but full answer to Mr. <hi>B.</hi> by the way, before I return to Mr. <hi>Lob.</hi> I will very briefly consider what Dr. <hi>O.</hi> says to this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, concerning that Reproach they cast upon the Reformation by their Separation from the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He at first gives them very good Words too, as Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> did, but adds, <note place="margin">Original of Churches. Pref. <hi>p.</hi> 33.</note>
               <hi>We are not obliged to make what they did, and what they attained unto, and what they judged meet as to the Worship and Government of the Church, our absolute Rule:</hi> and takes some pains to prove this by six Arguments; now I know no Body that ever asserted it: and therefore here he disputes without an Adversary. But is there no difference between rectifying some Defects, (as he observes they themselves did in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view of their Liturgy in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s days) and condemning the fundamental Constitution of a Church as setled and reformed by them? Is there no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between saying they were infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and that it is a Sin to alter any thing they did; and utterly rejecting every thing they did with reference to Church Government, and the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
<pb n="liv" facs="tcp:204354:29"/> of Religious Offices, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful for a Christian to submit to? A Church may alter its own Constitutions upon prudent Considerations, as the reason and circumstances of things va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: but to charge any Church with such fundamental Corruptions, as make its Communion unlawful, as those Men do, who separate from it, is to make it such a Reformation as must be essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially reformed, which I take to be no great credit to our first Reformers.</p>
            <p>And yet this is the sum of what Dr. <hi>O.</hi> pleads in this cause, as will appear from a particular review of what he says.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That they did not think themselves obliged, they did not think meet to abide within the bounds and limits of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the Church, which had been attempted before them, by Men wise, learned, and holy even in this Nation.</hi> And he instances in the Reformation of <hi>Wickliffe and his Followers, in Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony whereunto many suffered Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> But did <hi>Wickliffe</hi> ever attempt the modelling of a Church, or drawing up a body of Articles of Faith? He spake freely against some abuses in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent thing from reforming a Church
<pb n="lv" facs="tcp:204354:29"/> in Doctrine, Discipline, and Worship; and therefore it is no wonder, our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers did not confine themselves to his Platform of Reformation, when he had given none.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>They</hi> (our first Reformers) <hi>did not at once make what they had done them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be a fixed Rule in these things; for themselves made alterations in the Service-Book which they first composed.</hi> They did so; but they did not alter, nor give any reason to suspect, that they thought there was any need of altering the main Principles of their Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. They still retained Episcopal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, the use of a Liturgy, and Ceremonies, but cast out some Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of less Antiquity, and most lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to abuse, tho the People were most fond of them; the true reason of which we may read in the Preface to our Common Prayer-Book. And those blessed Martyrs thought that second re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view to have made the Reformation so perfect, that there was no need of any farther change.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The first Reformers, both Bishops and others, both those who underwent Martyrdom at home, and those who lived in Exile abroad, differed among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb n="lvi" facs="tcp:204354:30"/> in their Judgments and Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions about those things, which are now under contest.</hi> What those Differences were, the Dean has explained more particularly, in his Preface, which Dr. <hi>O.</hi> takes no notice of. Bishop <hi>Hooper</hi> scrupled wearing the Episcopal Habits, but soon submitted to that upon <hi>Bucer</hi>'s Letter, and such other Means, as were used for his Conviction: But surely, he did not think the Episcopal Office to be Antichristian, when he himself was a Bishop, and suffered Martyrdom without renouncing his Bishoprick: nor the use of Liturgies, nor all Ceremonies, without which in those days he could not officiate. The Troubles of <hi>Frankfort</hi> give an account of those Differences, which began a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, which were quite of another nature from most of our present Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes; they did not condemn Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, nor Liturgies, nor all Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, which are the great Quarrels now against our present Establishment.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>They differed in these things from all other reformed Churches, with whom they did absolutely agree in Doctrine, and had the strictest communion in Faith and Love: These things,</hi> he says, <hi>were the
<pb n="lvii" facs="tcp:204354:30"/> stated Rule and Order of their Church.</hi> What is this? Was the Difference a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a Form of Prayer? All the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Churches retained this, and Dr. <hi>O.</hi> differs from them all in this Point even to this day. Was it about Ceremonies? The <hi>Lutheran</hi> Church retained more than our Reformers did, and no other Church did absolutely condemn them. Was it then about Episcopacy? The <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches came as near this as they could, in setting up their Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendents, and neither <hi>Calvin</hi> nor <hi>Beza</hi> condemned the Office as Antichristian; but would gladly have submitted to reformed Bishops: as the most learned Divines in the <hi>French</hi> Church at this day would.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>In their Reformation they avowedly proposed a Rule and Measure unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, which was both uncertain, and in many things apparently various, from the Original Rule of these things given by Christ and his Apostles, with the Practice of the first Churches. And this was the State and Example of the Church under the first Christian Emperors; as our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor confesseth.</hi> But what does the Dean confess? That they overlooked the Scripture, and the example of
<pb n="lviii" facs="tcp:204354:31"/> the first Churches, and followed only the pattern of the Church under the first Christian Emperors? Where does he in the least intimate any such thing? And would there be a better pattern for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation than the first Churches. whose example is the best exposition of the Scripture Rule, which otherwise in these matters every Man expounds according to his own Fancy? What Dr. <hi>O.</hi> thinks the fault of our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, we take to be the great Glory of our Reformation, and an eternal Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of it, from the Cavils of our new Reformers.</p>
            <p n="6">6. But they were <hi>newly delivered from horrid Darkness, met with great Oppositions and Difficulties.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore accommodated things, as much as safely they could, to the Inclinations of People. This is all his own surmize, confuted by the History of our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and signifies nothing, till he can shew us those Corruptions and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects occasioned by such a compliance. But to return to Mr. <hi>Lob.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The third Argument he makes for the Dean, is this, <hi>The Dissenters oppose Episcopacy and Innocent Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Inquiry p. 17.</note>
               <hi>notwithstanding their Antiquity.</hi>
               <pb n="lix" facs="tcp:204354:31"/> What the Dean says, is only this, that it is great Temptation to People to be reconciled to Popery, when they find the universal Practice of the Ancient Church, (which had Episcopal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and significant Ceremonies) charged with Popery; for they will not think it credible, that the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church should so soon degenerate, without any notice taken of it by Friends or Enemies. What does our Inquirer answer to this? not one word, he never so much as taking notice, where the force of the Objection lay, but runs out into other Debates no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpose.</p>
            <p>Eirst, He says, <hi>The non-embracing E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacy does not advantage the Papists;</hi> but it may do so, if People judg of the rest of Popery, by their rejecting Episcopacy as Popish. For when they find that Episcopacy has always been the Government used in the ancient Church (which Popish Priests may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily convince them of) and yet that it is rejected by our new Reformers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion of Popery, it may easily induce them to believe, that what they call by the odious name of Popery was the primitive practice, and then what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="lx" facs="tcp:204354:32"/> our Author can say against the Authority of Antiquity, will not keep them from turning Papists.</p>
            <p>The rest of his Answer consists in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming against Antiquity. 1. That he will allow no Antiquity but the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; nor do we allow any Antiquity <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ibid</hi> p. 20.</note> which is contrary to the Scriptures; and we plead even the authority of Scripture both for Episcopacy, and the lawfull use of significant Ceremonies. 2. That Antiquity at best is but a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane authority, and therefore no foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for Faith. And yet without the Testimony of Antiquity, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys the Scriptures down to us, we can have no divine Faith, and why may we not then allow that a credible Witness of an Apostolical practice? 3. <hi>We have but a short account of the Transactions of the first three hundred years:</hi> But all the account we have is for Episcopacy and Ceremonies, and the Account is much larger too than I perceive this Author is aware of; and Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands these things better, durst not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Testimony of the third Century. 4. <hi>'Tis certain that those Errors crept in gradually, the Iniquity being a Mystery, that began even in the Apostles days.</hi> But
<pb n="lxi" facs="tcp:204354:32"/> 1. He must prove that the <hi>Iniquity</hi> was Episcopacy and Ceremonies, which is evidently false from the Apostles own account of it. 2. <hi>This Mystery of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> did not work in the Apostolical Churches, but among separating Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, who were carefully noted and avoided by the Apostles and their suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors; and therefore these Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Churches, who yet retained Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Government, and the use of signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant Ceremonies, could no more be charged with this Mystery of Iniquity, than the Church of <hi>England</hi> can with all the Frenzies and Enthusiasms of Schismatical Dissenters.</p>
            <p>But he says, the Plea of Antiquity is the great Argument urged by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, <note place="margin">Pag. 19.</note> and he calls it <hi>Bellarmine's Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-bolt:</hi> This we grant, but I would ask our Author, whether the Papists can maintain their Ground upon this Plea of Antiquity? Bishop <hi>Jewel,</hi> when he made that famous Challenge, did not think they could; and he who finds how our Protestant Writers beat them at this Weapon, and make all their Thunder-bolts recoil upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, will be of the same mind. Our Author had been an admirable Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
<pb n="lxii" facs="tcp:204354:33"/> against <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who would have answered him in a word, by reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Antiquity, as a vain Plea; but our great Champions were so silly as not to think of this way; they allowed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity to be a good Plea, but denied the Popish Pretences to Antiquity; that the early Authorities they insisted on, were counterfeit and spurious, and their latter Authorities had not Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity enough to prove a Primitive Practice; which is all that Mr. <hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> means in those words he has ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from him; for that Mr. <hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> never meant to reject Primitive Antiquity, is evident from his Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the Apostolical Institution of Episcopacy at the end of his Book, which I am willing to hope, our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer never saw; for though Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance be a Fault in a censuring Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, yet it is more pardonable than Knavery: The Demonstration Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> deduces at large, and sums it up in these Words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Episcopal Government is acknowledged to have been received universally in the Church presently after the Apostles times. Between the Apostles times and this, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently after, there was not time enough
<pb n="lxiii" facs="tcp:204354:33"/> for, nor possibility of so great an Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and therefore there was no such Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration as is pretended. And therefore Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy being confessed to be so Ancient and Catholick, must be granted also to be Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick,</hi> quod erat demonstrandum.</p>
            <p>And I hope our Inquirer now will grow so <hi>modest,</hi> as not to cite Mr. <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingworth</hi> any more against an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from Antiquity.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The next Argument he makes for the Dean, is this, <hi>Our Divisions give great Advantages to the Papists;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 21.</note>
               <hi>and the Dissenters by their Separation, have caused the Division.</hi> The first part of this he acknowledges; what he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers to the second Part, who is the Divider, I have considered in the second Chapter of the Defence.</p>
            <p>And as for what he adds to prove, <note place="margin">Pag. 26.</note> that it is against the Principles and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of the Dissenters to promote Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, it is nothing to the purpose, for the Dean had no where charged them with such a design; only shews that the way they take is the effectual Course to bring it in.</p>
            <p>But that account he gives, of the Dean's <hi>falling in with</hi> Bellarmine, <hi>enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 28.</note>
               <hi>the same Principles, and arguing
<pb n="lxiv" facs="tcp:204354:34"/> from the same Topicks</hi> with him is very pleasant.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and the Dean are both for Union; but I hope it is not the same Union they are for. Thus Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> are both for Union, and so fall in with <hi>Bellarmine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet,</hi> were both on the imposing side. But still it was not the same side, and thus our Dissenters fall in with <hi>Novati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus</hi> and <hi>Donatus,</hi> and other Ancient Schismaticks, who were on the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing side,</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The Doctor suggests the impossibility</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 29.</note>
               <hi>of a limited Toleration, and therefore his Objections are made against an universal and unlimited Toleration,</hi> as <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s are. The Dean shews, that upon the Principles now urged for Toleration it must be universal, and Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> should have shown, where they might stop, without injuring the Arguments now urged for Toleration; but to say the Dean suggests a limited Toleration to be impossible, when he himself has given a platform of such a Toleration, does not become the pretended mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty of our Inquirer.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="lxv" facs="tcp:204354:34"/>4. <hi>The Doctor asserts the danger of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding from the settled Constitution.</hi> Yes; unless it be done with great Care and Prudence, but he does not deny the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of such Alterations in some Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; for he makes Proposals himself about it not indeed recede from setled Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, but to make such Alterations as may consist with preserving the Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; which every one knows was not <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s Doctrine, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not worth the while to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his parallel, which savours of so much Ignorance or Dishonesty, that no ordinary Reader, who will compare his Allegations, can be imposed on by them.</p>
            <p>Thus that Calumny, That the Dean does his utmost to prevent a Protestant Union, deserves only to be scorned: He <note place="margin">Pag. 32.</note> makes the Dean's opposing <hi>the alteration of some Penal Laws against Dissenters, to be an Opposition of an unlimited Tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and so he is against a Protestant Union: And to represent the thing odiously, calls <hi>a boundless Toleration, an indulging of Drunkenness, Swearing, Felony, Murder, Adultery;</hi> and hopes that Penal Laws against Dissenters may be taken away, without allowing a
<pb n="lxvi" facs="tcp:204354:35"/> boundless Toleration. But I suppose Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> knew better things, that by an unlimited Toleration the Dean meant only a Toleration of all Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Sects of Religion, in which sence it has been opposed by our Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters themselves, who when time was, would not tolerate the Church of <hi>England,</hi> nor the Presbyterian Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters allow the Toleration of the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents; and I would desire Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> to tell me, how an unlimited Tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can be hindred without some Penal Laws, or whether to oppose an unlimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Toleration be to oppose a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Union.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Dean's fifth Argument, as he calls it, is; <hi>That the Dissenters accepted of his Majesties gracious Toleration, given them seven or eight Years ago.</hi> This is <note place="margin">P. 43.</note> very modestly stated! The Dean shews what Advice has been given by the Jesuites to bring Popery again into <hi>England;</hi> the chief of which was a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Toleration to break us to pieces, which Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> own'd, was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by a Popish Interest. This the Dissenters gladly complied with, notwithstanding the Advantage it gave to Popery, and wrote in the Defence
<pb n="lxvii" facs="tcp:204354:35"/> of it, and justifyed the Toleration of Papists themselves. Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> makes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of all this.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He cannot understand that a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration to Dissenters, unless Popery also be tolerated, can do any Mischief; as if dividing us, which was plainly the Effect and Design of the Tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, would not weaken the Protestant Interest; as if Papists need any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Toleration, when Dissenters, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any exception, are tolerated; as if Jesuites could not easily creep into Conventicles, and seduce our People, and inflame our Divisions, when they are so publickly open for every body. But he says, the Knowledg of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel encreases by Toleration, and that is the greatest Security against Popery. Knowledg I grant is, but I am much mistaken if a Liberty to all Sects and Factions of Religion be the true way to encrease true Knowledg. But he defies these Maxims of the Jesuites introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Popery by a Toleration; to which I shall only answer, That wiser Men do'nt. <hi>But the Doctor suggests, that Jesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites might creep in under the notion of Dissenters; and cannot they rather slide into great Preferments under the covert of
<pb n="lxviii" facs="tcp:204354:36"/> a Gown, a Cassock, a Surplice? The Temptation surely is greater, and the way much more easy.</hi> This is like his other Mistakes: A regular and well governed Society cannot be so easily imposed on; there are a great many Trials and Tests, which they cannot bear; they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable for their Doctrine and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by a certain Rule and Standard; and therefore cannot do that Mischief in the Church, which they can in a Conventicle: To get Preferments in the Church, how great a Temptation soever it may be, is not so likely a way to ruine the Church, as to draw away People from the Communion of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He answers, as for their accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Toleration, it was only Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to their Prince; and whoever is angry at it, <hi>yet 'tis the resolve of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Dissenters to be ready on all Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions to shew their Loyalty and Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to his Majesty for every instance of his Bounty towards his dissenting, but most dutiful and loving Subjects.</hi> I am glad to hear this with all my heart, and I wish this Fit of Loyalty and Gratitude, may continue: but suppose the King be not thus bountiful to them, can they be Loyal still? And what is all this to
<pb n="lxix" facs="tcp:204354:36"/> the Question, Whether their accepting such a Toleration was not the way to promote Popery?</p>
            <p n="3">3. He attempts to vindicate their writing in favour of the Toleration of Papists; but I think few People want an answer to this: For if it were justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to write for the Toleration of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, I suppose they think it very fit, they should be tolerated, and then who are the Men that promote Popery?</p>
            <p>His sixth Argument is a lewd Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that the Dean charges them with promoting Popery, <hi>by an over-fierce opposing the Papists.</hi> He founds his Charge upon these Words: <hi>Now the</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 38.</note>
               <hi>Dissenters tack about, and strike in with the rage of the People, and none so fierce against Popery as they, whereby they marr a good Business by over-doing it.</hi> These last Words are added by Mr. <hi>Lob,</hi> to make up the Dean's Argument for him, and the former are designed only to shew that wonderful alteration the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the Plot made in them, who <hi>from trucking under-hand for toleration with the Papists,</hi> now on a sudden will not allow any one to be thought so hearty Enemies to Popery, as they. But I have wasted too much Time and
<pb n="lxx" facs="tcp:204354:37"/> Paper already in answering so mean a Pamphlet.</p>
            <p>And now I was in hope my Trouble had been over for this time, when there comes to my hand a little Pamphlet newly printed, called <hi>The History of Conformity, or, a proof of the mischief of Impositions.</hi> I have not time at present to give a particular answer to it, and indeed so far as I understand it, it needs but very little answer; and therefore I shall dismiss it only with some short Reflections upon its Design.</p>
            <p>In his Introduction he gives a short account of the Popish Designs, charges the severe Acts against Dissenters, and the universal Toleration as the Fruits of their Counsels; and adds, <hi>one would reasonably think, there should not be one Protestant in</hi> England, <hi>who should not think it high time for our Superiors to unite all Protestants.</hi> I am very much of his Mind, and declare that I know not a Man, who does not think so, unless they be among themselves, who have made use of this opportunity to assault the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the most rude and barbarous manner, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any new Provocation.</p>
            <pb n="lxxi" facs="tcp:204354:37"/>
            <p>What things he would have abated he does not say, but insinuates some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing about our Ceremonies and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer-Book, which he says were retained, and formed in this Method meerly <hi>to commend our Worship to the Papists,</hi> which yet has not attained its Effect.</p>
            <p>I grant this might be one, but not the only true Cause of it, and a very good Cause it was, and the reason of it holds to this day, not to retain any Popish Rites or Ceremonies to humour them, which our Church did not; but not to separate farther from them, or any other Church than necessity requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which is the true Principle of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Union.</p>
            <p>The Dean had assigned three other Reasons of retaining those Ceremonies still in use among us, but he says, <hi>he had better have said nothing:</hi> Let us briefly examine the Reasons of such Confidence.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Dean's first Reason was <hi>a due reverence to Antiquity;</hi> but he says, <hi>some will say, How have we reverenced Antiquity, in retaining three of their Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, and leaving out twenty more of greater Antiquity?</hi> I answer,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="lxxii" facs="tcp:204354:38"/>(1.) He will be much troubled to shew twenty more Ceremonies of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Antiquity, than those we retain; however this Confession shews the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justifiable peevishness of our Dissenters in scrupling the use of those Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, which were used in the Primitive Church, and in clamouring against a Church so much better reformed, than the Primitive Churches themselves were with respect to the number of their Ceremonies.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) We know, when Ceremonies were multiplied in the Church, Wise Men in those days complained of it, as St. <hi>Austin</hi> did, tho the humour of the People was such, That they could not reform it. And therefore we reverence the Judgment of Antiquity, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining some antient Ceremonies, and in lessening their Number.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) There were a great many Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies peculiar only to some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches, others of a more general use in the Catholick Church; and it is easy to shew, that our Reformers had a special Regard to this in their Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; and it will be hard to name any Ceremonies of such a Catholick practice, as those retained in our Church.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="lxxiii" facs="tcp:204354:38"/>2. The second Reason for retaining these Ceremonies, is, <hi>to manifest the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and Equity of the Reformation, to let the Papists see, we did not break Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with them for things meerly indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent.</hi> He answers, <hi>What need was there of our keeping two or three Ceremonies, to testify we did not differ from them for meer matters of indifferencie, when so many Books, so many Disputations, testified we differed from them because of their Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in many things, and their Doctrine of Justification by Works.</hi> I answer, The reason of our Separation is as well dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by our Practice as by our Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes; and if we had separated farther than we had differed, it had been an unjustifiable and causeless Separation, and had given the Enemies great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage against us, and might have hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the Reformation, as the Dean shews, it did in <hi>France,</hi> from the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies of <hi>Thuanus,</hi> and <hi>Francis Bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi> in his Ecclesiastical Commentaries, and his answers to <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The third Reason was, <hi>To shew our consent with other Protestant Churches,</hi> which he says, <hi>is of all the most weak;</hi> and yet is forc'd to acknowledg, that the <hi>Lutherans</hi> did retain the use of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
<pb n="lxxiv" facs="tcp:204354:39"/> but says, that they were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly reformed, and had peculiar reasons for their retaining them, which with great reverence to those first Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers he attributes to Pride and Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation between <hi>Luther, Zwinglius</hi> and <hi>Carolostadius,</hi> and to the soft and easy temper of <hi>Melancton</hi> and <hi>Justus Jonas:</hi> and yet there is not any one Confession of the Reformed Churches, to the best of my remembrance, which condemns the use of significant Ceremonies. <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi> justifies those now retained by us, in that judgment he passed on the first Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s days; and in his excellent Letters to Arch-Bishop <hi>Cranmer</hi> and Bishop <hi>Hooper, de re Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiarra;</hi> and as the Dean has observed, <hi>Calvin</hi> in his Letter to <hi>Sadolet, declared, That he was for restoring the Face of the antient Church; and in his Book of the true way of Reformation,</hi> he saith, <hi>he would not contend about Ceremonies, not only those things which are for decency, but those which are Symbolical.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for his <hi>History of Conformity,</hi> he ought to have called it, <hi>a History of the Reformation,</hi> but he was sensible, that had been an odious Title, considering at what rate he has managed it; for his
<pb n="lxxv" facs="tcp:204354:39"/> whole design is to cast Dirt upon our Reformers and Reformation in its seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral advances, under the name of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity and Impositions; for it seems this admirable Reformer would have had the Church setled without any Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, as he calls them, that is, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any standing Laws or Rules of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Worship, which all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons should be obliged to submit to; which had been an effectual way to drive out Popery, considering how the People were at that time addicted to it. How partially he has related things, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Body, who is in any measure ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the History of those times, will easily discover: And it is very happy, that Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> has so late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly published his excellent History of the Reformation, which will convince all Men, with what grave and delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Advice and Counsel, and admirable Temper, that whole Affair was managed.</p>
            <p>I should have been greatly out in guessing, what the design of this History had been, had I not found it declared in these Words. <hi>From this short and</hi>
               <note place="margin">History of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity. <hi>p.</hi> 30.</note>
               <hi>true account of the rise and growth and effects of these Impositions, a good account may be given of a late Authors History of
<pb n="lxxvi" facs="tcp:204354:40"/> Separation, the smallness of it at first, and the further increase and improvements of it, which indeed did much vary, according as Impositions varied and multiplied.</hi> Now two or three short Observations will evidently confute the whole design of <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> this History.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That when the Impositions were greatest, there were no Non-Conformists but Papists. In the first Common Prayer-Book of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>6th</hi> there were a great many more Ceremonies retained, and of a more doubtful Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, than now we have, and <hi>all Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters enjoyned by the Statute to read those Prayers, and all the People to hear them,</hi> and yet then he confesses, <hi>there were no Non-Conformists to direct that Act a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 4.</note>
               <hi>but only Papists. But upon the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Edition of the Common Prayer-Book</hi> (which was reformed much for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and many doubtful Ceremonies left out) <hi>there appeared a considerable Party who opposed themselves to it:</hi> And it is evident this Party grew for want of keeping Men close to the Rule; the scruples of <hi>Hooper,</hi> and that favour which was shewn to <hi>John a Lasco,</hi> and the remissness of Discipline, were the true Causes of it.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="lxxvii" facs="tcp:204354:40"/>2. To satisfy these Scruples, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy was reformed again; but did that mend the matter? It did silence some Disputes, which were all soon ended here by Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s coming to the Crown, who restored Popery again. Several of the Protestants fly beyond Seas: there our Author cannot pretend they were under any Impositions, and yet a Party of them at <hi>Frankford</hi> begin to quarrel about the <hi>English</hi> Service, and in those Forreign Churches, where they were under no Impositions, suck'd in those Notions of Discipline, and ways of Worship, as gave so much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> when they returned: so that hitherto Liberty, not Impositions, made Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> came to the Crown, the Reformed Religion was restored with very little alteration from King <hi>Edward</hi>'s second Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; those who fled in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s days, returned, and many of them lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened with other Principles, than they carried away with them. For a time he says, <hi>No Subscription was required to</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 7.</note>
               <hi>any thing by any legal Authority, nor was the use of all the Common Prayer-Book, or
<pb n="lxxviii" facs="tcp:204354:41"/> an exact observance of the Ceremonies ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally urged.</hi> So that thus far Imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions did not make Men Dissenters, but Liberty did; for by this Favour and Indulgence Nonconformity encreased, and Men began to innovate every where, to abound with Scruples, to decry Ceremonies and Forms of Prayer, to decry Episcopacy, and to set up a Presbyterian Parity and Government; and yet he confesses all this while <hi>very few Men were Sufferers. But the body of the Nonconforming Ministers and People were much quiet, until not only Arch-Bishop</hi> Parker <hi>was dead, but Bishop</hi> Grindal <hi>also, who succeeded him, who died about 1583, about the</hi> 25th <hi>of the Queen.</hi> Which is so plain a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation out of his own mouth of his History of Conformity, that nothing could be more; for in this time it was of Liberty and Indulgence, that they so propagated their Faction, and grew so insolent as to threaten both Church and State. This made the Queen take new measures, and keep a stricter hand over them, and exact Oaths and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions, and make severe Laws a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, as Sir <hi>Francis Walsingham</hi> relates the Matter, as I before observ'd;
<pb n="lxxix" facs="tcp:204354:41"/> and I can assure him, this did not make new Dissenters, but reclaimed many old ones. King <hi>James</hi> from his own Experience of the factious restless Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of those People in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and from the Experience of the Queen here, pursued the same Method, and kept them in good order; and so did King <hi>Charles</hi> the first, till necessity of Affairs forced him to such Concessions, as at last cost him his Head. And how they have encreased of late Years, he himself has informed us, by severe Laws made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, and Liberty and Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence granted them, as the Fruits of Popish Counsels. From whence it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appears that not Impositions and forceable Restraints, but Connivance and Liberty, which gave scope to the wanton and giddy Fancies of Men, were the true Causes at least of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease os Dissenters, and therefore his Argument for Union, founded on this Mistake, must fall with it. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all, I shall only observe how Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> have adorned their Title Pages, with suitable places of Scripture; for such Men seldom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach but in Scripture-language, which sanctifies the lewdest Insinuations.

               <p>THE Preface to the <hi>Modest and Peaceable Inquiry,</hi> being little else than a short repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of what we shall meet with again in the <hi>Inquiry,</hi> excepting some Expostulations with the <hi>Dean,</hi> and such a wondring Humour as is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to those men who are either ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant themselves, or have a mind to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:204354:47"/> impose upon those who are, I shall wholly pass it over, or if any thing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear material in it, I shall bring it in its proper place; and therefore, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other Introduction, I shall first consider the Title, and then examine the Inquiry it self.</p>
               <p>The Title is, <hi>A Modest and Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Inquiry into the Design and Nature of some of those Historical Mistakes that are found in</hi> Dr. Stillingfleet'<hi>s Preface to his Ʋnreasonableness of Separation.</hi> I find some men use a great deal of Art in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixing a specious and flattering Title, to their Books, which serves as well as a Bush and a painted Sign to invite Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomers; but then the Title and Book seldom have any relation to each other; and thus it is with our Author, unless he understands these words <hi>modest and peaceable,</hi> and <hi>historical Mistakes,</hi> in some other Sense, than what they bear in common Use.</p>
               <p>For, first, let us consider how modest this <hi>Inquiry</hi> is, and I confess, there are some passages very modest in it, but others, which do not so well deserve that Character. He begins his Epistle to the <hi>Dean,</hi> with observing, how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious the Papists have been ever
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:204354:47"/> since the Reformation, to <hi>ruine</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>and the Churches of Christ in it;</hi> which he sufficiently proves from <hi>their Rebellions and Insurrections in King</hi> Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward's <hi>days, the</hi> Spanish <hi>Armado in Queen</hi> Elizabeth's, <hi>the Gun-powder Treason in King</hi> James's <hi>&amp;c. and the late Hellish Conspiracy, which was designed for the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Extirpation of the Protestant Religion, and the universal Destruction of all the Professors thereof, whether Episcopal or Dissenter.</hi> But this modest man takes no notice, that King and Kingdom, Church and State, have been once ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined already by such modest Dissenters, and may be in a fair way for it again, if we suffer our selves to be charmed and lulled asleep by such modest <hi>Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers:</hi> We are aware Sir, what a Popish Zeal would do, and what a Factious Zeal has done, and think ourselves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, as much as we can, to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Designs of both: but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I confess it was very modestly done to pass over this, that while men are zealous against Popery, they may fear no danger from any other Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>It was very <hi>modestly</hi> done to charge the <hi>Dean</hi> with designing <hi>to gratifie the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:204354:48"/> Roman Faction, by acting so sutably to the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Inq. p. 5.</note>
                  <hi>Jesuits Measures, as discovered by Mr.</hi> Dugdale <hi>and some others, which is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile the Dissenters, as the Dr. hath done,</hi> &amp;c. And at the same time, to laugh at the Jesuits and <hi>Coleman,</hi> their Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <note place="margin">p. 35.</note> as great Fools for designing to bring in Popery, by the Toleration of Fanaticks; for, you must know, that they themselves press hard for a Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but would not be thought hereby to gratifie the <hi>Roman</hi> Faction, and to design the bringing in of Popery, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi>'s and the Jesuits Method. But, yet it was not very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly done, to charge the Dr. with <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling Dissenters,</hi> unless by reviling, he means, confuting them; and I dare as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure him, that does not gratifie the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Faction, nor does Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> nor any one else, say that the Jesuits took these measures of promoting Popery, by confuting Fanaticism: if they had, I would venture to say, that they were much more mistaken in this, than in those other measures they take, of doing it by a Toleration.</p>
               <p>But it neither savours of Modesty nor any great disposition to peace, to insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, as he does in this place, that the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:204354:48"/>
                  <hi>Dean,</hi> by convincing them of the sinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Separation, endeavoured to put a <hi>Sham Plot</hi> upon them, and to expose his <hi>Majesties-loyal Subjects</hi> (great Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty still) <hi>to the merciless Cruelty of bloody Papists,</hi> unless he thinks, that Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, Dissenters, and Plotters, are equivolent Terms; and then the Dean's design was plainly to deliver them from the least Suspition of Plots, by endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to make them true Church-men and Loyal Subjects.</p>
               <p>He makes the <hi>Dean</hi> to represent <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting Protestants to be the Jesuits Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Inq. p. 4.</note> to bring in Popery, in which he abuses the <hi>Dean;</hi> unless, by <hi>Instruments,</hi> he mean such Tools as are made use of by cunning Artists, to do that which they themselves do not understand. Such kind of passive Tools we confess they are, for they do the Papists work for them, though (as we charitably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve) without knowing that they do so; and this is all that the <hi>Dean</hi> ever asserted, that their Divisions and Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations were a great inlet to Popery, and fomented by the Papists for that end.</p>
               <p>Now from hence he draws a very modest and peaceable Inference, that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:204354:49"/> the <hi>Dean</hi> represents them to <hi>be men, not worthy of any savour from a Protestant Prince, for surely such are the Jesuits En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines.</hi> Now, this being his own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the Text, I would desire him to consider how to answer it against the next Time; for it is evident, the <hi>Dean</hi> did not think so, when he made so many kind Proposals for their Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, nor did our Author believe, he did; but out of great Modesty and Peaceableness, endeavoured to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the People that he did, whose good Opinion and Favour, I perceive, he prefers before the favour of any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Prince.</p>
               <p>This was a very <hi>peaceable design</hi> to perswade the people never to look into the <hi>Dean</hi>'s book, or to stone him, as an implacable Enemy to all <hi>Loyal Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:</hi> but the next device is better than this, to complain to the Parliament of him, as a man who disparages Their Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and casts bones of Contention in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their House (such Crimes as these, <hi>Loyal Dissenters</hi> are never guilty of, when Parliaments please them) for so among his Conjectures at the Doctors end and design in all this, he thinks it hard to determine, <hi>Whether it was to cast
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:204354:49"/> Contempt on the Wisdom of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who entertain other Sentiments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Dissenters, or whether it be to cast a Bone of Contention into the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment House,</hi> (the Supposition of which, <note place="margin">Inq. <hi>p.</hi> 4. 5.</note> seems to me, to argue no great opinion of the Wisdom of the Parliament) <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to prevent the uniting and strengthning the Protestant Interest, as well for divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the House from these other Methods, which are most necessary</hi> (that, Sir, you should leave to the Wisdom of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, who, I perceive will not please you long, unless they chuse your most necessary Methods) <hi>for the impeding the future growth of Popery?</hi> And thus the <hi>Dean</hi> after all his Triumphs over Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is grown, on a sudden, a great Friend to it, by endeavouring to divert the Parliament from those Methods, which are most necessary to suppress it; <hi>Or whether to raise one of the severest Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions against that loyal and truly Protestant Party,</hi> (excepting the matter of <hi>Ʋriah) which cannot be weakned or impoverished, but to the advancing of Papal Designs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If these be not <hi>modest and peaceaable Inquiries,</hi> I will give you one more, <note place="margin">p. 13.</note> where he very ingeniously insinuates the most effectual way to keep out Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:204354:50"/> for ever, by pulling down the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and distributing their Lands among the Nobility and Gentry: <hi>Since the Destruction of Episcopacy may be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the Royal Distribution of Church Lands among our Nobility and Gentry, than which a greater Blow can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be given to the Papal Interest in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>as appears by the Heroick Actings of</hi> Henry <hi>the Eighth in a like case.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This indeed is home to the Business, and a very <hi>modest and peaceable</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal; for though he brings it in only to shew how much it is against the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of Papists to pull down the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Episcopacy, of which, more hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; yet he so highly commends it, from the heroick Example of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, and as the greatest Blow that can be given to the papal Interest, that he must be very dull, who does not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand his meaning.</p>
               <p>For, in short, it is an admirable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress to Lords and Commons, to pull down Bishops, and divide their Lands, which is a very <hi>peaceable and uniting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign;</hi> but then it insinuates such Scurvy Reflexions on the Nobility and Gentry of <hi>England,</hi> that, had it not been writ by a <hi>Loyal Dissenter,</hi> it might have been liable to ill constructions.</p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:204354:50"/>
               <p>For it supposes, that there is no such security of their zeal against Popery, as their having a good share of the Church Lands; that is, that they do not so much value their Religion, as a good Estate. That they are men who may be tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to pull down an Excellent Church, in hope to make a prey of it: or else this Writer is none of the wisest nor mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destest men to make such a motion.</p>
               <p>And yet never any thing was more foolishly proposed; for, is it not an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable reason for pulling down Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Bishops to keep out Popery, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>H.</hi> 8, pulled down Popish Abbies and Monasteries, which were the Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series of lewd People, the Pope's sworn Vassals, and the Seminaries of Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Rebellion? this is such a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of rooting out Popery, as was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thought on by any of our Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Princes (for I do not speak of the <hi>Loyal and truly Protestant Party)</hi> who, instead of pulling down Bishops, erected several new Bishopricks and Collegiate Churches out of the Ruines of Popish Monasteries.</p>
               <p>And there is another thing, I doubt, may deter our Nobility and Gentry from such a Design, that when Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:204354:51"/> was pulled down, and the Church Lands sold by the <hi>Loyal and truly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Party,</hi> the Crown Lands and most of their own Estates were sold with them.</p>
               <p>And another thing is to be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whether, if ever such a distribution of Church Lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> should come to be made a second time, the old Purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers, who are as <hi>Loyal and true Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi> as any men, would not claim an old Right, and so our present Nobility and Gentry lose the Reward of their Zeal? These are untoward Objections and Scruples, which our <hi>Modest and Peaceable Inquirer</hi> is concerned to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, if he hope this Proposal should take.</p>
               <p>I shall give but one Instance more at present, of the great <hi>Modesty and Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness of this Inquirer;</hi> for to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of every thing would be endless, his whole <hi>Pamphlet</hi> being the most perfect and exact Pattern of true <hi>Fanatick Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty and Peaceableness.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>For this our <hi>Inquirer</hi> charges the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Inq.</hi> p. 33.</note> Dean <hi>with setting a greater value on the Honour and Reputation of men than on Ʋnion, or the relieving tender Consciences, in order to Ʋnion.</hi> Had he been to deal with Mr. <hi>A.</hi> he would presently have sent him a Writ for a <hi>Melius Inquiren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum,</hi>

               <p>But that every sober Christian may see how maliciously and impudently this <hi>modest Inquirer</hi> charges the <hi>Dean</hi> with <hi>setling a greater value on the Honour and Reputation of men, than on Ʋnion.</hi> I would desire my Readers to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that these words, which he thus Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesques, and which I have transcribed out of the <hi>Dean</hi>'s Preface, are part of a long Discourse, beginning at page 81. in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to that more <hi>peaceable Inquiry</hi> what may be done <hi>for the Satisfaction of mens Consciences, and for the Peace and Stabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of this Church?</hi> where he makes as fair and equal Proposals for the Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Dissenters, as any man can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, who will be pleased with any thing less than a total Subversion of the present Constitution.</p>
               <p>As for the Laity, who allow the use of the Liturgy, but scruple some Rites and Ceremonies annexed to the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of the Sacraments, after having declared, that after the most diligent Search, he could find no ground for any
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:204354:52"/> scruple of Conscience about such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, nor for the peoples separation from other Acts of Communion, on account of some Rites they suspect to be unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; yet for the Satisfaction of such men, he offers his Opinion, that it would be a part of Christian Wisdom and Condescension in Governours, if the sign of the Cross were wholly taken away, or confined to the publick Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of Baptism, or left indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, as the Parents desire it: that kneeling at the Lord's Supper might be imposed on none that scruple it, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that such persons receive with least offence to others, and rather standing than sitting, because the former is most agreeable to the practice of Antiquity, and of our neighbour reformed Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es: that as to the Surplice in Parochial Churches, it is not of that Consequence as to bear a Dispute one way or other, with some little Alteration in the use of God-fathers, and God-mothers, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move some Scruples, which have been started of late days about that matter. I have given a brief account of this, that every one may judge of the Modesty and Honesty of our <hi>Inquirer,</hi> who tells, us as the Sense of the <hi>Dean</hi> and the Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:204354:53"/> party, that they have once impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed these things, and cannot now honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably recede from the least <hi>Iota:</hi> so that it seems, the Cross in Baptism, kneeling at Sacrament, and the use of the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice, which they have made such a horrible Stir and Pother about, and which are the only Ceremonies retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> are now dwindled away into something less than the least <hi>Iota,</hi> which other people will call nothing; which shews what an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Controversie this has been, that they have divided the Church, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed the Peace and Unity of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, for that which they themselves now think to be less than the least <hi>Iota.</hi> But this ever was, and ever will be the Temper of these men, mightily to undervalue every thing, which is granted them for Peace sake, till they can overturn the present Constitution of our Church, to say no worse: From whence the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may learn, what Thanks they are like to have for any Comprehension or Indulgence, which does not overthrow the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to proceed, as for other people, who will not communicate with us upon these Terms, he proposes a limited In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence <note place="margin">Praes. p. 85. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>From hence the <hi>Dean</hi> proceeds to consider the case of <hi>ejected Ministers,</hi>

The meaning of which is, that we are sincerely willing to make any Condescensions for Peace-sake, which will not overthrow the Church of <hi>England,</hi> nor insinuate a false and scandalous Accusation of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulness of our Constitution, and Rites of Worship, which we cannot do with a safe Conscience, because we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the contrary, that our Worship is lawful, and that our Church ought to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:204354:54"/> be upheld, as the most Apostolical and best Reformed Church in the World, and we are not so charitable as to give ease to other mens Consciences to injure our own, and thereby condemn the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi> which, whatever this <hi>Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer</hi> thinks, will give great advantage to Popery, of which more hereafter.</p>
               <p>And, is not our Author a skilful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter, as well as a <hi>modest Inquirer,</hi> who from these words can prove, that the <hi>Dean</hi> prefers the Reputation of men before the Honour of Jesus Christ? but I do not much wonder at his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake, considering, that Honour and Reputation is the great Support of their Schism, which made him so easily sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it of others, and expound the most innocent words by the Principles of their own Faction.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the Modesty and Peaceableness of this <hi>Inquiry.</hi> Let us now consider what those <hi>Historical Mistakes</hi> are, which he has found in the <hi>Dean</hi>'s Preface, Has he mis-cited any Authors, or reported any thing for matter of Fact which is not so? I confess, I was much surprized when I saw this charge in the Title page, which I could not suspect so exact and faithful a Writer as the

                  <hi>Dean</hi> of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> to be guilty of; which made me the more scrupulously examine this Pamphlet, to find where those Mistakes were; but I have look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till I have wearied my self, and can find none, nor so much as any pretence that there are any, but onely in the Title Page; though I found Mistakes enough of this <hi>Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,</hi> of which he shall hear more in due time.</p>

                  <p>WHoever judges of the temper and Spirit of our Dissenters, by their loud Out-cries, and passionate Expostulations for Union, must needs
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:204354:55"/> wonder to see these Breaches conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, and that they can neither agree among themselves, nor with the Church of <hi>England;</hi> for, were these men of such Peaceable and uniting Principles, one would think it were no impossible thing, nor very difficult, to reconcile our present Differences, and to unite into one Christian Body and Society. But the truth is, <hi>Ʋnion</hi> will not serve their ends, but talking of <hi>Ʋnion,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring it, when they mean nothing less, does more effectually promote their Designs. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> can at any time give you twenty good and substantial Reasons, and more if you want them, to prove the necessity and advantages of <hi>Ʋnion,</hi> and as soon as he has done, can lay down as many Dividing Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, which shall make <hi>Ʋnion</hi> absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impossible, unless all men will be of his mind.</p>
                  <p>This course our <hi>Inquirer</hi> takes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clames largely and frequently of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of <hi>Ʋnion,</hi> and the mischief of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision:</hi> especially at such a time as this, when it is our Interest to <hi>unite</hi> against a <hi>common Enemy,</hi> when we are all in such present danger of being destroy'd by the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:204354:55"/>
                     <hi>Papists,</hi> if we do not unite; For, this seeming zeal for <hi>Ʋnion</hi> is a very plausi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing, and begets a great Opinion in the People of them, and a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion for them, and reflects a great deal of <hi>odium;</hi> especially upon the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Clergy of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as if they were the onely men who opposed this <hi>happy Ʋnion;</hi> and this, as far as we can guess, by the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of their Actions, and other Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, is the only Design of their <hi>great noise</hi> and <hi>clamor</hi> for <hi>Ʋnion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And yet this is so thin and transpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent a Fallacy, that I wonder every Porter cannot see through it; for if their zealous <hi>Out-cries</hi> (I had almost said <hi>Out-rages)</hi> for <hi>Ʋnion,</hi> be an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their great love to <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Ʋnion,</hi> I would give something to see the man who is an Enemy to <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Ʋnion:</hi> for I never met with any man yet but would speak very kindly of it: I am sure there are no men in the World who have appeared more zealous for <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Ʋnion,</hi> both in their Sermons and Writings, than the Episcopal Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of this Church; and therefore so far we are equal.</p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:204354:56"/>
                  <p>The Reverend <hi>Dean</hi> was himself a great Example of this Zeal for Union, in that excellent Sermon, which has been made the occasion of these fierce and unchristian Disputes; and it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pretty to observe, how this <hi>modest</hi> and <hi>peaceable Inquirer,</hi> who pretends so much Zeal for Union, endeavours to prove the <hi>Dean</hi> a Papist, for this very Reason; for he tells us, <hi>That he falls in</hi>

                     <hi>with</hi> Bellarmine, <hi>entertaining the same Principles, and arguing from the same To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks with him;</hi> and gives this very In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of it, that <hi>as</hi> Bellarmine <hi>doth, in the general, highly extol Ʋnion, Peace, and Concord, in the Church, making it a note of the true Church</hi> (and I wish <hi>Bellarmine</hi> had never given a worse note of the true Church, than Union) <hi>even so the Dr. (tho he doth not make Peace and Concord a note of the Church</hi> (and therefore it seems, does not fall in with <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> though I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Dr. will not much differ with him on this point) <hi>yet he doth speak enough of it's Excellency and Desireableness; for Ʋnion is a lovely name, which is in great Esteem, even among such as will not part with a Toy or Trifle for the obtaining the thing.</hi> What a dangerous thing is this <hi>Ʋnion?</hi> That a man cannot speak of it's
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:204354:56"/>
                     <hi>Excellency</hi> and <hi>Desireableness,</hi> unless he be a Papist? What a mighty passionate Admirer of <hi>Ʋnion</hi> is this <hi>Inquirer?</hi> And yet, methinks, if <hi>Ʋnion be so lovely a name,</hi> (as he adds in the very next Words, without considering how well they agree with the former) a man may at least commend it moderately, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the suspicion of Popery; and he has not proved, that the <hi>Dean</hi> was immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate in it's Commendations: he only says, that he has spoke <hi>enough,</hi> not that he has spoke too much of it's Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and therefore I charitably hope, that he may be no Papist for all this. Though I fear, we cannot bring off Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> so well, who, in his late book, entitled, <hi>The true and only way of Concord,</hi> has spent about seventy pages in describing the Nature, Excellency, Necessity and Advantages of Union; and in his <hi>Search for the</hi> English <hi>Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi> comes so near <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> as to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert <hi>Ʋnity to be essential to the universal and particular Churches,</hi> p. 42. And that which is essential, is certainly a very good and infallible note of a Church: But it is to be hoped, that this is none of the most dangerous points of Popery, or how Popish soever some men may be
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:204354:57"/> in these Speculations, there is no appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent danger, that ever they will practice such a peice of Popery.</p>

                     <hi>God and wrong to their own Consciences, comply with the Terms imposed by you for</hi> Union, <hi>their Non-complyance is a Sin,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:204354:57"/> that in it's Tendencies advanceth Popery; but if the Dissenter cannot conform to your Impositions, as they really cannot, and you can, without Sin, make such easie Overtures for Peace, as may be grateful to Dissenters, your refusing in this case to comply, doth sufficiently convince you to be the Divider and Promoter of the Papacy.</hi> As for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the Papacy, of that more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; at present I shall consider the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, as it relates to the Divider, and shall first examine the Terms of it. He makes doing a thing <hi>without Offence to God,</hi> and <hi>without wronging their own Consciences,</hi> to signifie the same thing, which yet are of a very different Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and very often separated. A man may offend God in doing that wherein he does not wrong his own Conscience, as all those do, who break any divine Law in Complyance with the Judgment of their own Conscience, as too many, I fear, do; unless we will say, that no man ever followed an erroneous and mistaken Conscience, or that he did not displease God in doing so. And a man may wrong his own Conscience in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what is, in it self lawful, but judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unlawful by him, and so far sin in doing it, when he does not offend God
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:204354:58"/> with respect to what he does; as is plain in the case of those who do a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing against their Conscience. Now our <hi>Inquirer</hi> is certainly in the Right so far, that whoever cannot comply with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out both <hi>offending God,</hi> with respect to the Nature of the Action, and <hi>wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own Conscience,</hi> can be no Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick; but then his bare saying that <hi>they really cannot,</hi> is no sufficient Proof of this: if he were sufficiently assured, what the Judgment of all the Dissenters is in this point, (which certainly, no one man can be secure of) he might then conclude, (if he knew them all to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Conformity to the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to be a Sin) that they could not comply without wronging their own Consciences: but there is something more required, to prove such a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance to be an offence against God, any otherwise than as it is against their Consciences; but he does not meddle with this, and I suppose will think bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it, before he undertakes it. But this is a pretty Insinuation, that every thing that is against their Consciences, is a Sin against God; that is, that their Conscience is a Rule to God, not the Law of God a Rule to their Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:204354:58"/> the last of which, I confess, is too true, but I must deny the first, unless we will make the Will and Law of God, as uncertain and various, and contrary to it self, as the Consciences of men are. And the latter part of his Argument is as faulty and precarious as the first; for, he tells the <hi>Dean, And you can, without Sin, make easie Overtures for Peace, as may be grateful to Dissenters; your refusing, in this case, to comply, doth sufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you to be the Divider.</hi> Now, how this <hi>Inquirer</hi> understands this, or ever should, unless he intends to set up a <hi>Spanish</hi> Inquisition for mens Consciences and secret Opinions, I cannot imagine; I am confident, the <hi>Dean</hi> never told them any such thing, and I am apt to guess, that if those Overtures, which he has already made to <hi>Dissenters,</hi> be not <hi>grateful,</hi> he can make none, without Sin, that will; that is, without wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own Conscience, and offending God, in pulling down the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and indeed, it is impossible to make such Overtures, as shall please all Dissenters, if you will reckon the <hi>Independents,</hi> and the <hi>good Protestant Dissenters</hi> the <hi>Quakers,</hi> without it.</p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:204354:59"/>
                  <p>But, suppose the <hi>Dean,</hi> or any other of the Episcopal Clergy, could make such Proposals, and did not, how does this prove them to be the <hi>Dividers?</hi> If the present terms of Communion are lawful and innocent, those are the <hi>Dividers</hi> who <hi>separate,</hi> not those who make no <hi>new Overtures,</hi> when there is no need of it? And how can he prove that private men are bound to make Proposals which they have not Authority to Enact into Laws, when it can only shew their good will, and, it may be, expose them to the Censure of their Superiors, for their sakes who will not thank them for it, but has no more effect than to write another <hi>Eutopian Commonwealth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Substance of this Argument we find in another Dress afterwards; <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Inq.</hi> p. 25.</note>
                     <hi>The Church, without sin, can part with their indifferent Ceremonies, but</hi> Dissent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>without sin, cannot comply with them; what then must be done for</hi> Union? <hi>Must the</hi> Episcopal <hi>comply in things wherein they can, without Sin? or must the</hi> Dissent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers <hi>sin, and loose their Peace with God for</hi> Union? And, a little after, he adds, <hi>This is the state of the case, the</hi> Dissenters <hi>would</hi> unite <hi>but cannot, the</hi> Episcopals <hi>can, but will not; the</hi> cannot <hi>of</hi> Dissent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:204354:59"/>
                     <hi>and the</hi> Episcopals will not, <hi>doth make the</hi> Division; <hi>but who is the</hi> faulty Divider? <hi>If the true reason of our Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion lay on the Dissenters</hi> will not, <hi>when they</hi> can, <hi>'twould be easie to conclude them obstinate and perverse, what, not to do what they</hi> can <hi>for</hi> Peace? <hi>but since they</hi> would, <hi>but</hi> cannot, <hi>without</hi> Sin, <hi>how can they be the</hi> Dividers?</p>
                  <p>Now this is all Trick and Fallacy, when he sayes, <hi>the Church, without sin, can part with their indifferent Ceremonies:</hi> If by <hi>the Church</hi> he means any thing less than the King and Parliament, it is false; for all the Bishops and Clergy in <hi>England</hi> cannot, without <hi>Sin,</hi> part with these <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Ceremonies,</hi> till the Law enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them be repealed: unless he thinks it no Sin to disobey Authority in <hi>indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent things;</hi> which, if he does, I can assure him, the Church of <hi>England</hi> does not; and, if by <hi>indifferent Ceremonies</hi> he means <hi>Episcopacy</hi> and <hi>Liturgies,</hi> as he must, to please <hi>Dissenters,</hi> since no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing less will please them, the Church of <hi>England</hi> does not account these <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Ceremonies,</hi> nor think she <hi>can part with them without sin:</hi> and when he says, <hi>that the Dissenters, without sin, cannot comply with them;</hi> if, by <hi>without sin,</hi> he
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:204354:60"/> means without breaking some Divine Law, it is false; for there is no Law to forbid our Obedience to Civil and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Governours, in <hi>indifferent things:</hi> if he means, that they must act contrary to their Conscience, that is, their own Opinion and Judgment of things, they may be the <hi>Dividers</hi> and <hi>Schismaticks</hi> for all that, unless we will say, that no man, but a profligate Knave, who sins against his Conscience, can be a Schismatick.</p>
                  <p>The like Answer may serve for his <hi>will not,</hi> and <hi>cannot;</hi> if by the Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pals <hi>will not,</hi> he means, that they will not do, what they may by Divine and Humane Laws, and with a just respect to the good Order and Government, and Edification of the Church, and the Regular Administration of Holy Offices, they are faulty in it, but may be no Schismaticks notwithstanding, so long as they exact no sinful terms of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: and, if by the Dissenters <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,</hi> he means their private Opinions, and Persuasions, which hinder their Compliance, they may be the <hi>Dividers</hi> still, if their Perswasions be erroneous.</p>
                  <p>And, to convince him how fallacious this way of reasoning is, I will form an
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:204354:60"/> Argument exactly like his, which, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, he will not be well pleased with. <hi>If the Dissenters can without Sin, obey their Governours in</hi> indifferent, <hi>that is, in</hi> lawful <hi>things, but will not; and the</hi> Episcopal <hi>would be content to part with</hi> indifferent <hi>things for</hi> Union, <hi>but cannot, who is the</hi> faulty Divider? <hi>what must be done for</hi> Union? <hi>Must the Dissenters comply in things wherein they can without Sin, or must the Episcopal sin, and lose their Peace with God for</hi> Union? I would desire our <hi>Inquirer</hi> to think better of it, and answer this Argument, if he can, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out shewing the Sophistry of his own.</p>
                  <p>But my Design is not so much to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer so <hi>inconsiderable a Pamphlet,</hi> as to take occasion to remove some Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and prevailing Mistakes; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I shall more particularly examine this Matter: for, if there be any force in this Argument, it consists in these two things. First, That all things, which are, in their own nature, <hi>indifferent,</hi> may, without Sin, be parted with: And se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That the Opinion of Dissent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that <hi>indifferent things</hi> are unlawful in the Worship of God, is a just Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for parting with them: For, if it be not lawful to part with every thing that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:204354:61"/> is <hi>indifferent,</hi> those who retain the use of some <hi>indifferent things,</hi> cannot meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, upon that account, be called <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> or <hi>Schismaticks;</hi> and if the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Dissenters, that all <hi>indifferent things</hi> are <hi>unlawful,</hi> be not a sufficient Reason for parting with them, then there may be no fault in the Episcopals <hi>will not,</hi> nor a sufficient justification or excuse in the Dissenters <hi>cannot.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, as for the First, That all things, in their own nature, <hi>indifferent,</hi> that is, such things as are neither commanded nor forbid by God, as any parts of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Worship, may not, <hi>without Sin,</hi> be parted with, appears from hence, because there can be no Publick and Solemn Worship, no Face or Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of any Discipline or Government in the Church, without the Use of some such <hi>indifferent things;</hi> All Actions must be cloathed with some such <hi>external Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,</hi> as though they are not essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to the <hi>moral nature</hi> of the Action, yet are necessary to the <hi>external perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> of it, A man who is to remove from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>York,</hi> is not bound ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to go thither on foot, or to ride on Horse-back, or in a Coach, or in a Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon; each of these wayes are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:204354:61"/>
                     <hi>indifferent;</hi> but yet if he will tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel to <hi>York,</hi> he must use one or other of these <hi>ways of Motion;</hi> not any one in particular is necessary, but yet some or other is: A man who is disposed to be <hi>charitable,</hi> is not con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>in'd to any one sort of <hi>Charity,</hi> but may either <hi>redeem</hi> Captives, and <hi>release</hi> poor Prisoners, by paying their Debts, or <hi>make provision</hi> for Widows and Orphans, or <hi>build</hi> Schools or Hospitals, according as his Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Ability serves; but if he will be <hi>charitable,</hi> he must do some good <hi>chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus we will suppose, that every man, in his <hi>private devotions,</hi> is at liberty to chuse for himself the Time, and Place, and Habit, and Posture of <hi>Prayer,</hi> and whether he will use <hi>mental</hi> or <hi>vocal Prayers,</hi> whether a <hi>set Form</hi> of words, or <hi>extemporary</hi> and <hi>conceived Prayer;</hi> whether he will pray out of a Book, or from his Memory; but yet some <hi>time,</hi> and <hi>place,</hi> and <hi>posture,</hi> and <hi>habit</hi> is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, not to the <hi>nature</hi> of the Duty, but to the <hi>performance</hi> of it, and he must pray either with or without a <hi>Form, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We cannot say that any one <hi>indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent thing is necessary</hi> and <hi>unalterable,</hi> for
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:204354:62"/> then it would be no longer <hi>indifferent,</hi> but we must say, that the use of some <hi>indifferent</hi> and <hi>uncommanded things</hi> is <hi>necessary,</hi> especially in Publick and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Acts of <hi>Worship,</hi> and in the <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> Administration of Church-Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and Government, unless they can shew us, where Christ has, by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Law determined all the <hi>external Circumstances,</hi> and <hi>Rites,</hi> and <hi>Modes</hi> of <hi>Worship,</hi> and given us an intire Body of <hi>Ecclesiastical Laws</hi> for Discipline and Government, or think it possible to perform all the Duties of <hi>publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> without any <hi>external circumstances</hi> of Worship.</p>
                  <p>Were our <hi>Dissenters</hi> but so honest, as impartially to consider the several <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels</hi> and <hi>Platforms</hi> of their own Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and the Publick Worship in Use among them, they would quickly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover how many things are daily Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised by them, without the least pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to a <hi>Divine Command,</hi> and which they themselves alter, as often as they see or fancy a Reason for it.</p>
                  <p>Where have they an express Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to build publick Places for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Assemblies, to be appropriated to such Uses? much less is there any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:204354:62"/> Command to meet, and pray, and preach in <hi>Coffee-houses, Play-houses, Bear-Gardens,</hi> as we know some of them have done, and do at this day? If the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and circumstances of <hi>Religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> be so exactly described by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and his Apostles, how comes it to pass that they differ so much among themselves in these matters? that some begin their <hi>Exercises</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> with Prayer, and reading some part of the Scripture, and then sing a <hi>Psalm</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Rhyme, (which is so late an Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that certainly it could not be an <hi>Apostolical Constitution)</hi> and then pray again in the Pulpit, and preach upon some Text of Scripture, and then pray over their Sermon again: but others can find no time for reading the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at all, but begin with a <hi>Psalm,</hi> and then shew their own <hi>Gifts</hi> in praying and preaching? Where do they find a Divine Command for reading the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the <hi>Desk,</hi> and preaching in the <hi>Pulpit?</hi> What Command can they shew for praying <hi>without a Form,</hi> any more than for praying <hi>with one?</hi> for preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and praying by the <hi>Hour-glass,</hi> and especially on <hi>Fast-dayes,</hi> for praying a <hi>full hour</hi> at least? What Command have

                     <note place="margin">James.</note> What Command have they for <hi>sitting</hi> or <hi>lolling</hi> in their Seats all the time of Prayers, or for the Ministers preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with their <hi>Hats off,</hi> and the Peoples hearing with their <hi>Hats on?</hi> What Command have they for receiving the <hi>Communion</hi> at <hi>Noon,</hi> and turning the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> into a <hi>Dinner?</hi> for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving in the <hi>Church,</hi> and not in an <hi>upper Room</hi> of a <hi>private house?</hi> sitting, and not in a posture of <hi>leaning,</hi> as our Saviour received? (for <hi>Religious Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions</hi> must not vary with the Custom of the Countries.) What Command have they for giving the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> to <hi>Women,</hi> when Christ onely gave it to <hi>men,</hi> though he had a great many <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Disciples</hi> also at that time?</p>
                  <p>It were easie to ask a great many more such Questions, but these are enough to convince any honest and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:204354:63"/> man, that he does, and, of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, must use, a great many external Circumstances of Worship, which are no where commanded by God, and therefore are, in their own nature, <hi>indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,</hi> and yet that some such <hi>indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent things</hi> are absolutely necessary in external Worship: for when men pray, it must be in a form of Words or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, either kneeling, sitting, stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or prostrate, or some such like po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, either covered or uncovered, and so it is in other Acts of Worship; and therefore, though we should sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose all Times, Places, Postures, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be equally <hi>indifferent;</hi> yet some or other, are necessary, because no external Action can he performed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them.</p>
                  <p>Now, if publick Worship cannot be performed without some <hi>indifferent Ʋsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> then all <hi>indifferent things</hi> cannot lawfully be parted with, and therefore the Bare not parting with <hi>indifferent things,</hi> cannot make any man or Church a guilty <hi>Divider;</hi> for though a Church may part with such, or such <hi>indifferent</hi> Ceremonies, it cannot part with all, continuing a Church; and therefore, certainly may retain some, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:204354:64"/> those that she has, if they be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and comply with the end and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Worship, as well as any other. For if the Argument lie against <hi>indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Ceremonies</hi> considered as <hi>indifferent,</hi> (as it must do here, if it have any sense in it) no Church can possibly, according to these Principles, avoid the Guilt of Schism, unless she alter her Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as often as every capricious Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morist shall alter his Opinions; and this is as evidently true, as the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of forty years can make it. The <hi>Presbyterians</hi> disliked the <hi>indifferent Ceremonies</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and therefore pull'd it down; but were they ever the nearer Union for this? by no means. The Independents as much disliked the Presbyterian Model, and therefore set up a purer Church of their own, and the Quakers and other Sectaries, neither liked them, nor one another; so that unless we can so model a Church as to please every man's Fancy, who is seldom pleased long with his own; we had as good stay where we are. Indeed this Argument lies equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against all Churches in the World, who retain the use of any <hi>indifferent C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>stoms or Ceremonies,</hi> which other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:204354:64"/> cannot, in Conscience, comply with: and thus the Presbyterians, Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and all Sectaries, are Schismaticks to one another; the only Difference is, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> calls <hi>indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent things, indifferent;</hi> but our <hi>Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> call their <hi>indifferent Ʋsages,</hi> neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, and pretend Divine Commands and Institutions, which they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet produce. And thus I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, the Church is the <hi>Divider,</hi> and <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters,</hi> though they separate without Cause, are very guiltless and innocent, if a true understanding of the Nature of Christian Liberty can make a Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick, and a superstitious and ignorant mistake of <hi>indifferent things</hi> for <hi>necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> can justifie a Separation.</p>
                  <p>I can foresee but two Objections, which can be made against this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course; the first is, that I confound <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different</hi> Circumstances of Action, with <hi>indifferent</hi> Ceremonies of Religion. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that though some <hi>indifferent</hi> Circumstances must be acknowledged necessary in the external exercise of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, yet no such particular Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances ought to be imposed, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main <hi>indifferent</hi> in their use, as well as in their Nature.</p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:204354:65"/>
                  <p>As for the first, that I confound <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different</hi> Circumstances of Action with <hi>indifferent</hi> Ceremonies; the Answer is very plain and easie, that there is but one Ceremony enjoyned by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which cannot be reckon'd among the necessary Circumstances of Action, and that is the Cross in Baptism, which is of such ancient use in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church, upon a great many other Accounts besides Baptism, that he must condemn all the Churches of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian World, which we have any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of, in Ecclesiastical Writers, who accuses it of Superstition or Popery; not to take notice now, that the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Church used a great many other Ceremonies in Baptism, much more lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and obnoxious to Fanatick Censures, which are now disused among us: and since it is evident, how little these men will be pleased merely with taking away the use of the Cross (this <hi>Inquirer</hi> falling so rudely upon the <hi>Dean,</hi> after the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal of taking it away, or leaving it <hi>indifferent)</hi> we may still keep an ancient and useful Rite, when parting with it will contribute nothing to <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Ʋnion.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>But, the Surplice and kneeling at the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> which are the two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ceremonies retained by our Church, and if they please, they may reckon kneeling at Prayers, and standing up at the Hymns, the <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> the Creed, and the Gospels, are nothing more than the Circumstances of Action, for they are reduced either to Postures or Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, which are two necessary Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of religious Actions, unless it be decent to worship God naked, or pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to worship him in no Posture at all.</p>
                  <p>And, if they be grieved still, that these particular Habits and Postures are preferred before others, because of their <hi>Significancy,</hi> and so are turned into <hi>sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical</hi> Ceremonies, I would desire them to consider, that there is no other Rule whereby to determine the <hi>proper Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances</hi> of <hi>Worship,</hi> but by their <hi>Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificancy;</hi> which has often made me wonder, That men, in their Wits, should quarrel at any external <hi>Circumstances</hi> of Worship, upon account of their <hi>Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy:</hi> if they signifie nothing but what is good, what is worthy of God, and his Worship, and becomes his Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.</p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:204354:66"/>
                  <p>How shall we know, whether we should pray and praise God, and feast at his Table, sitting, standing, or kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with our Hats on, or off, but by considering, which is most decent and suitable to the Nature of the Action? That is, by considering what the <hi>Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>Signification</hi> of such Postures are, and which of them signifie most agreeably to the nature of such religious Actions.</p>
                  <p>Why it is thought so undecent to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in Sack-cloath and Ashes on days of publick Joy, when our work is to praise God for his Goodness and Mercy or to adorn our selves on days of Fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Humiliation? To look Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly when we praise God, and to put on very chearful and pleasant Looks, when we confess our Sins, and depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his Judgments? Why does St. <hi>Paul</hi> take so much Pains to shew the Unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of a man's praying covered, or a Woman unconvered, from the different Signification of them? 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> II 4, 5, 6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The truth is, it is not so <hi>indifferent</hi> as some imagine; what the <hi>external cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances</hi> of <hi>Worship</hi> are: for the <hi>signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy,</hi> or, as others would call it, the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:204354:66"/>
                     <hi>symbolicalness</hi> of such <hi>Circumstances,</hi> must determine their <hi>sutableness</hi> or <hi>unsutable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> to <hi>religious actions;</hi> for no Time, nor Place, Habit, or Gesture, or Words can be <hi>pleasing</hi> to God, which do not signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie something <hi>worthy</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> and whether the Signification be <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>instituted,</hi> it is much at one, so it signifie <hi>certainly</hi> and <hi>constantly;</hi> to be sure the <hi>meer significancy</hi> of such <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,</hi> cannot be a <hi>fault,</hi> when there is nothing of any value in them but their <hi>significancy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For we must consider, that the <hi>true worship</hi> of God consists in the <hi>inward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion</hi> of our <hi>Minds,</hi> which none can know but God and our selves; but <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal worship</hi> is nothing else but a <hi>visible</hi> representation of <hi>inward</hi> and <hi>invisible devotion,</hi> which must be seen in our <hi>external behaviour;</hi> and therefore, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less our <hi>words</hi> and <hi>actions, postures</hi> and <hi>habits</hi> do one way or other signifie our <hi>devotion</hi> and <hi>reverence</hi> for God, they cannot be so much as the <hi>external cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> because there is nothing of <hi>Religion</hi> in them.</p>
                  <p>Indeed it is impossible for men, let them do what they can, to strip their <hi>actions</hi> of all <hi>signification,</hi> which should
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:204354:67"/> make them more <hi>modest</hi> in blaming any thing that <hi>signifies well,</hi> and more <hi>care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> of doing any thing that <hi>signifies ill.</hi>

                  <p>When men <hi>sit</hi> at Publick Prayers, and, it may be, with their <hi>Hats</hi> half on, this will signifie, either that they do not believe that God <hi>sees</hi> them, and that the holy Angels <hi>attend</hi> our <hi>Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,</hi> or that God does not matter <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal honour,</hi> that is, <hi>publick</hi> and <hi>visible worship;</hi> or that they do not owe so much <hi>reverence</hi> to <hi>him,</hi> as to their <hi>Prince.</hi> When they <hi>put on their Hats</hi> to hear a Sermon, it signifies, that either they do not believe <hi>preaching</hi> to be a part of <hi>God's worship,</hi> (and yet those who are most guilty of this, hardly think any else to be a <hi>necessary part</hi> of <hi>publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship)</hi> or that they are not in God's <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate presence,</hi> while the <hi>Sermon</hi> is <hi>preaching,</hi> or that they hear Sermons, not as <hi>Disciples</hi> and <hi>Scholars,</hi> but as <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi> and <hi>Judges.</hi> When they <hi>sit</hi> at the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Table,</hi> it is a true <hi>symbolical cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi> which represents a very great <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity</hi> with Christ, but signifies very little <hi>distance</hi> or <hi>worship.</hi> When they <hi>pray</hi> an hour or two together, any thing that comes next, to those who cannot believe that they are all this while <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired,</hi>

                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:204354:68"/>
                  <p>As for the second Objection, That, though some <hi>external circumstances</hi> are <hi>necessary to publick worship,</hi> yet there is no <hi>necessity</hi> that they should be <hi>determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> but they may be left to <hi>every man,</hi> or <hi>Church,</hi> to <hi>chuse</hi> what they <hi>please;</hi> I shall return two or three short Answers to it.</p>
                  <p>First, Unless they can prove, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that they <hi>may,</hi> but that they <hi>must</hi> not be determined, no Church can be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused of <hi>Schism</hi> for determining such <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal modes</hi> and <hi>circumstances</hi> of <hi>worship,</hi> as are of <hi>good use</hi> and signification in <hi>Religion,</hi> or for obliging all in her <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> to observe them; for, if there be no necessity of leaving these matters at <hi>liberty,</hi> every Church may <hi>chuse</hi> for her self, and if she <hi>chuse well,</hi> those are the <hi>Schismaticks</hi> who reject her Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
                  <p>But secondly, This not only <hi>may,</hi> but <hi>must</hi> be so, if we will allow that Church-Governours and Christian Magistrates are bound to take care of <hi>publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;</hi> for <hi>publick worship,</hi> (as you have already heard) consists in the <hi>external</hi> and <hi>visible expressions</hi> of <hi>Devotion,</hi> in <hi>times, places, postures, habits, words,</hi> or <hi>actions;</hi> and if these be not <hi>determined,</hi>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:204354:68"/> there is no security that God shall be <hi>worshipped,</hi> that is, shall be <hi>honoured;</hi> for, if men pretend to <hi>worship</hi> God in <hi>undecent words, places, postures,</hi> &amp;c. which are so far from signifying any <hi>Honour,</hi> that they signifie <hi>Contempt,</hi> how <hi>devout</hi> soever their <hi>minds</hi> may be, this is not <hi>external</hi> and <hi>publick worship,</hi> but a <hi>publick affront</hi> to the <hi>Deity;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, at least, some <hi>indifferent things,</hi> some <hi>external circumstances</hi> of <hi>worship</hi> must be determined, if our Civil and Ecclesiastical Governours are bound to take care that God shall be <hi>publickly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped,</hi> and that no <hi>publick scorn</hi> be put upon <hi>Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, To leave all the <hi>Externals</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> at <hi>liberty,</hi> is so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Cure</hi> of our <hi>Divisions,</hi> that it is the <hi>true Cause of them;</hi> and therefore, he is the <hi>true Schismatick,</hi> not who secures <hi>Christian Ʋnity</hi> by a <hi>setled</hi> Constitution, but who leaves every man at <hi>liberty</hi> to do as he list. For, I suppose, when every man is left to do as he will, he will do, <hi>as he will;</hi> and thus one man will like <hi>one way</hi> of <hi>worship,</hi> and another <hi>another,</hi> and those who happen to be of the <hi>same mind,</hi> will <hi>unite</hi> into one <hi>Church,</hi> and thus shall we have <hi>distinct Churches</hi>
                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:204354:69"/> and <hi>distinct Communions</hi> without end. This was the Effect of <hi>pulling down</hi> the Church of <hi>England</hi> heretofore, and this is that we <hi>complain</hi> of still; and our wise Author tells us, that the <hi>Church</hi> is the <hi>faulty Divider,</hi> because she has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined her <hi>Communion</hi> within certain <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Rules,</hi> which others will not <hi>conform</hi> to, and yet to have no certain <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Rules,</hi> is the most certain way to have no <hi>Ʋnion; Ʋnion</hi> may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served where there are <hi>fixed</hi> and <hi>setled terms</hi> of <hi>Communion,</hi> but it can never be preserved <hi>without it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus I have considered the first thing supposed in our <hi>Inquirer</hi>'s <hi>Sophistical Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,</hi> That all things, which are in their own nature <hi>indifferent,</hi> may be <hi>parted with, without sin;</hi> and proceed to the second, <hi>That the Opinion of Dissent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that</hi> indifferent things <hi>are unlawful in the</hi> Worship <hi>of God, is a</hi> just <hi>and</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary reason <hi>for parting with them.</hi> The plain sense of which is, That no <hi>Church</hi> can, without <hi>Schism,</hi> retain the most <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent</hi> and <hi>useful Ceremonies</hi> in Religion, if <hi>any</hi> man, especially if <hi>any number</hi> of men, think them to be neither <hi>innocent</hi> nor <hi>useful,</hi> though the <hi>Church</hi> still judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es them to be so.</p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:204354:69"/>
                  <p>Now, could they once gain this <hi>point,</hi> farewel to all <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Ʋnity</hi> in the <hi>Christian Church;</hi> for it is demonstrable, how impossible it is to strip Religion so <hi>naked,</hi> but there will remain some <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Rites</hi> and <hi>Ʋsages,</hi> which some men or other will <hi>condemn</hi> or <hi>scruple:</hi> We know what work there has been among the <hi>Quakers</hi> themselves, about <hi>praying</hi> with their Hats <hi>on,</hi> or <hi>off;</hi> and if this will admit a <hi>Dispute,</hi> what <hi>Religious Ceremonies</hi> can be <hi>secure?</hi> And yet, if this <hi>Principle</hi> were <hi>true,</hi> all other Churches must stoop to the <hi>rude</hi> and <hi>slovenly Dispensation</hi> of <hi>Quakerism,</hi> and quit all the <hi>modes</hi> of <hi>Religious worship,</hi> which they cannot prove to be expresly commanded in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Nay, if what I have already discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, be <hi>true,</hi> that <hi>Publick Worship</hi> consists in such <hi>external signs</hi> of <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,</hi> as are not <hi>peremptorily determined</hi> by a <hi>Divine Law,</hi> we must have no <hi>Publick Worship,</hi> unless all men can agree in the same <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>modes</hi> of <hi>worship;</hi> for, if any sort of men set up a <hi>peculiar way</hi> of <hi>worship</hi> for themselves, which other men do not like, and cannot <hi>joyn</hi> in, according to this <hi>Principle</hi> they are <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> and <hi>guilty Dividers:</hi> and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:204354:70"/> yet if no <hi>Church</hi> must set up <hi>Publick Worship,</hi> till <hi>all</hi> men are agreed about the <hi>External Rites</hi> of <hi>worship,</hi> I great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly suspect it will take up some conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient time, in such an Age as this to do it; Especially considering, that there is scarce any one thing relating to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal worship,</hi> but is <hi>scrupled</hi> or <hi>condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> by some or other. There are those who think it a gross piece of <hi>Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to erect <hi>publick Places,</hi> separated from all <hi>common</hi> Use, and <hi>devoted</hi> and <hi>conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated</hi> to the <hi>worship of God,</hi> especially if they be <hi>beautiful</hi> and <hi>magnificent,</hi> though they think they can never suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently <hi>adorn</hi> their own <hi>houses.</hi> Others think it <hi>superstitious</hi> to hear a Sermon with their <hi>Hats off,</hi> and others judge it <hi>rude</hi> and irreverent to <hi>put them on;</hi> Some think it a <hi>Sin</hi> to hear a <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Prayer,</hi> others as much condemn <hi>extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Effusions,</hi> when men say what comes next, which is not alwayes so <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>grave,</hi> so becoming <hi>Creatures</hi> and <hi>Sinners,</hi> and so <hi>reverent</hi> to Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God as good men <hi>wish.</hi> Some think it <hi>superstitious</hi> to confine our selves to <hi>kneel</hi> at <hi>Prayers</hi> or <hi>Sacrament;</hi> others, <hi>irreverent</hi> to <hi>sit.</hi> Taking a <hi>Text,</hi> and raising <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Ʋses,</hi> and observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:204354:70"/>
                     <hi>method</hi> and <hi>Order,</hi> and <hi>premedita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> before-hand what we have to speak, is thought by some as great a <hi>quenching</hi> and <hi>stifling</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> as <hi>praying</hi> by a <hi>Form.</hi> Others think the Christian Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, <hi>Baptism</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> to be as <hi>indifferent</hi> and <hi>needless,</hi> as some do <hi>external Order</hi> and <hi>Decency</hi> in <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship:</hi> and there want not those, who think the most <hi>indifferent</hi> and <hi>innocent Rites</hi> and <hi>Ʋsages</hi> to be <hi>unlawful,</hi> when the Observation of them is command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our <hi>Superiors.</hi> While this is the <hi>case,</hi> as it certainly is at this day, I would desire any man to shew me, how it is possible for any Church, of what <hi>denomination</hi> soever, whether <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> or <hi>Independent, &amp;c.</hi> to establish any <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Worship</hi> and <hi>Discipline,</hi> which shall not be <hi>scrupled</hi> or <hi>condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> by other Persons, and therefore must either have no <hi>Visible Church</hi> and <hi>Worship,</hi> or be <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> if it make a <hi>man</hi> or <hi>Church</hi> Schismatical, to establish any <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>worship,</hi> which some other Persons think <hi>unlawful.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to bring this matter to a short issue, it is evident, that in it self consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered an other man's thinking that to be <hi>unlawful,</hi> which I believe to be <hi>indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent</hi>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:204354:71"/> and <hi>lawful,</hi> does not make it <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful</hi> to me, any more than my think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such a thing to be <hi>indifferent</hi> and <hi>lawful,</hi> makes it <hi>lawful</hi> to him, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves it to be <hi>unlawful;</hi> and therefore, the Force of the <hi>Argument</hi> must lie in this; that by imposing such Terms of Communion, as I believe <hi>indifferent,</hi> but other men think <hi>unlawful,</hi> I am guilty of <hi>Schism,</hi> because I force them to separate, by denying them Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, unless they will do, what they believe to be unlawful, which no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest man can or will do.</p>
                  <p>Now the plain Answer to this, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in these three things; First, that though such and such particular <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> are, in their own Nature, <hi>indifferent;</hi> yet <hi>publick Worship,</hi> and the <hi>decent</hi> and <hi>orderly Performance</hi> of <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worship,</hi> which I have already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, cannot be done, without some <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different</hi> and <hi>uncommanded</hi> Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is not indifferent.</p>
                  <p>And secondly, That the way to <hi>Ʋni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> is not by stripping Religion of all <hi>indifferent Circumstances,</hi> for that is the way to have no Church, and no <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worship,</hi> but by curing mens super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious Conceits about them; for while
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:204354:71"/> men believe that things <hi>indifferent</hi> are <hi>unlawful</hi> in the Worship of God, tho you take away some <hi>indiffernt</hi> Rites, the same Objection will lie against what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is set up in the room of them, which will cause Divisions and Sub-divisions without number; as is evident in those divided Sects, which are now among us, who all cryed out (and do so at this day) against the <hi>Impositions,</hi> and <hi>Popish Ceremonies</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but could never agree about one way of <hi>Worship</hi> and <hi>Church-Government</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselves: but some refine the Church, till they refine it into <hi>Quaker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism;</hi> and the reason why others do not so, is because they have not Wit or Consideration enough to understand the Tendency of their own Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
                  <p>And thirdly, It is of greater Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ence to common Christianity, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver Religion from such superstitious Conceits, and maintain true Gospel-Liberty, and Freedom, than to receive such men into the Church, by indulging their Superstition. To assert <hi>indifferent things</hi> to be <hi>unlawful</hi> and <hi>sinful,</hi> is as gross Superstition, as it is to make such <hi>indifferent things</hi> necessary parts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:204354:72"/> and meritorious acts of Worship; one is the Superstition of the Fanatick, the other of the Papist; and the one places as much Religion in not doing <hi>indifferent things,</hi> as the other in doing them, both which are great Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Christianity; one as it destroys Christian Liberty, and is a necessary Cause of Schisms, Confusions, and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders in the Christian Church; and both, as they confound the Notions of Good and Evil, and nourish men in su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious Conceits of pleasing God, in doing or not doing something, which, considered in it's own Nature, cannot please him: so that this Dispute about <hi>indifferent things,</hi> is not so trifling, as some men imagine; and if we cannot keep men in, or reduce them to the Communion of the Church, without forfeiting our Christian Liberty, let them go, and (according to their usual Appeals) try it at the last day, who are Schismaticks, though parting with two or three <hi>indifferent Ceremonies,</hi> is of no great Consequence; yet to part with the doctrine of the Lawfulness of <hi>indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent things,</hi> or to countenance the contrary Doctrine by an unreasonable and fruitless Complyance with such men,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:204354:72"/> is to corrupt the Gospel, and to enslave the Consciences of Christians, and this we dare not do for the sake of any man: but this is abundantly enough, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to our <hi>Inquirers</hi> Search for the <hi>Schismatick.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is the most formidable man, a man, who, as a late Author, (I had called him <hi>learned,</hi> but for fear he should think it an Abuse, a <hi>counterfeit Epithite,</hi> and <hi>fleering Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion)</hi> tells us, is neither to be pitied nor envyed; (and I am very much of his mind, for a Reason I know) a man <note place="margin">Answer to D. <hi>St.</hi> as far as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the peaceable Design. p. 26. 27.</note> whose Soul does as much excel Dr. <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet</hi>'s Soul as a <hi>Flint</hi> does <hi>Free-stone,</hi> because <hi>Free-stone</hi> is not so <hi>sharp</hi> and <hi>acute,</hi> and will not <hi>strike Light;</hi> that is, <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Flame,</hi> as <hi>Flint</hi> does: it is a most admirable Comparison, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the D. will not envy Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> two such Perfections as these, the accuteness of a <hi>Flint</hi> to divide the Church, and it's striking Fire to burn and consume it; but the D. may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort himself, that <hi>Free-stone</hi> is fitter to grow into a Holy Temple than <hi>Flint.</hi> But he takes notice of another Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Mr. <hi>B.</hi> which is indeed the most formidable of any, that he has <hi>a Pen consequently, that is but turning the Cock,

                  <p>However, I have put on these <hi>Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> and do find, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> sayes, that he, who is not purblind, may see the <hi>Schismatick;</hi> if we do not mean the <hi>same man,</hi> I doubt his <hi>Spectacles</hi> are not <hi>true;</hi> and, I confess, they sometimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present things <hi>double,</hi> and sometimes the very <hi>same man,</hi> if you turn one side of the <hi>Spectacles,</hi> is a <hi>Schismatick,</hi> but if you turn the other side of the <hi>Spectacles,</hi> he is none. As for instance, There are, it <note place="margin">p. 3. 4.</note> seems, a sort of men, whom he calls <hi>passive Conformists,</hi> and they are, <hi>such as think a Reformation very desirable, but Conformity lawful to escape silencing and ruine</hi> (I suppose he means such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists, if there be any such to be found now, as he tells us elsewhere, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the last Civil Wars for a <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> without <hi>Bishops</hi> or <hi>Liturgy,</hi> and such as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and his Brethren would have been, had they been taken into the Church, and will be, whenever they are) <hi>and such as like Conformity for it self, and wish all others did conform,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:204354:74"/> but like not uncharitable Censures, or silen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings, or violence against Conscionable Dissenters, nor the Compulsions which have caused our Church-convulsions.</hi> I cannot guess who these men are, that can an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer every part of this Character. No honest Conformist, that I know of, will approve of <hi>uncharitable Censures,</hi> nor will exercise any violence against <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionable Dissenters,</hi> if he could tell who these are; for, I suppose, he would not have us to mistake those for <hi>consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable Dissenters,</hi> who perpetually <hi>libel</hi> Church and State, and trample upon all Sacred and Civil Authority, and live upon more than the Charity of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to disturb Publick Government: but if there be any such <hi>Conformists,</hi> who would have no restraint laid upon <hi>Dissenters,</hi> they may well be called <hi>passive Conformists,</hi> for it is no thanks to them, if they do not suffer once more all the Furies of a Fanatick Rage and Zeal.</p>
                  <p>Well, but are these <hi>passive Conformists, Schismaticks,</hi> or not <hi>Shismaticks?</hi> The Answer is plain; <hi>So far as they own the Schismatical dividing terms of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> that is, so far as they are <hi>Conformists, the Nonconformists must needs judge these
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:204354:74"/> to partake in Schism,</hi> that is, to be <hi>Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks;</hi> and this tells us what the <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformists</hi> judgment is, even of the <hi>most moderate,</hi> and meer <hi>passive Conformists,</hi> and consequently of the whole Church of <hi>England,</hi> that they are <hi>Schismaticks; yet as they reproach not Dissenters as Schismaticks, so neither are they accounted Schismaticks by the Dissenters.</hi> This is but equal dealing, I confess, one good turn requires another; the <hi>Conformists</hi> indeed are most <hi>generous</hi> in this, because they stand in less need of such a Favour; but the Dissenter makes the greatest Complement in excusing those from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Schismaticks, who, as they themselves say, <hi>partake in a Schism,</hi> that is, who are guilty of <hi>Schism:</hi> and hitherto, I always thought, that <hi>Schism</hi> denominated men <hi>Schismaticks;</hi> but he gives a reason why they do not account these <hi>passive Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists</hi> Schismaticks, <hi>because they are sound and peaceable brethren, and desire to live, as such, with others, and Schism is not their disposition nor predominant. Sound and peaceable,</hi> and yet <hi>Conformists?</hi> then there is no Heterodoxy in <hi>Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,</hi> nor <hi>any schismatical dividing terms of Communion;</hi> for if there be, a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formist,</hi> as a <hi>Conformist,</hi> can neither be
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:204354:75"/>
                     <hi>sound</hi> nor <hi>peaceable;</hi> and while they complement these <hi>sound</hi> and <hi>peaceable Conformists,</hi> they little consult their own Reputation; for, if <hi>Conformists,</hi> notwithstanding their <hi>Conformity,</hi> can be <hi>sound and peaceable, Nonconformists</hi> can be neither, unless they can shew us two distinct sorts of <hi>soundness</hi> and <hi>peaceableness,</hi> one peculiar to the <hi>passive Conformist,</hi> the other to the <hi>Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To say that a <hi>Conformist</hi> is no <hi>Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick,</hi> is to say that a <hi>Non-conformist</hi> is one▪ unless there may be a <hi>Schism,</hi> and neither of the <hi>Dividing Parties</hi> be a <hi>Schismatick;</hi> and to say that some <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists</hi> are <hi>sound and peaceable,</hi> is to say that all <hi>Nonconformists</hi> are <hi>neither;</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less two <hi>differing</hi> and <hi>dividing Parties</hi> may be both in the <hi>right,</hi> with respect to that very thing wherein they differ. But <hi>Schism is not their Disposition, nor predominant;</hi> but what is that to the purpose, since it is <hi>Practice,</hi> not <hi>Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,</hi> which makes a Schismatick? for he is a <hi>Schismatick</hi> who makes a <hi>Schism,</hi> whether he be disposed to be a <hi>Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> or not; as I suppose none are, but errant Knaves, who design and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to break the <hi>Ʋnity</hi> of the

                  <p>But however, <hi>Schism is not predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> in them; that is strange, that men should be guilty of <hi>actual Schism,</hi> and yet <hi>Schism</hi> not be <hi>predominant.</hi> What he <note place="margin">Search for a Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, <hi>p.</hi> 5. 6.</note> means by the <hi>predominancy</hi> of <hi>Schism,</hi> I confess, I cannot tell; for I take <hi>Schism</hi> to be then <hi>predominant,</hi> when it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails against <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Ʋnity;</hi> I find indeed, that he has a very odd Notion of <hi>Schism,</hi> that it <hi>has a great number of degrees,</hi> insomuch th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                     <hi>few Churches on earth are no way guilty of Schism, and yet are not to be called Schismaticks, where it is not predominant.</hi> Now though I will readily grant, that Schism may have different degrees of <hi>guilt,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to different <hi>circumstances</hi> and <hi>aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,</hi> yet <hi>Schism</hi> being nothing else but a breach of <hi>Christian Communion,</hi> or dividing our selves from the <hi>Ʋnity</hi> of <hi>Christ's Body,</hi> the nature of it is the same in <hi>all,</hi> and is not capable of less, or greater degrees, or, as the <hi>Logicians</hi> speak, <hi>non recipit magis &amp; minus:</hi> it may be a greater or less <hi>Schism,</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the number of the <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> its <hi>duration</hi> and <hi>extent,</hi> or the difficulty
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:204354:76"/> of the Cure, but it cannot be more or less a Schism; for where the Unity of the Church is broke by distinct and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite Communions, there is the full nature of <hi>Schism,</hi> which is as much <hi>Schism</hi> as <hi>Schism</hi> can be <hi>Schism;</hi> and where this is not, there is either no <hi>Schism,</hi> or on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a partial <hi>Schism,</hi> which is like a great Wound in the Arm, which yet does not sever it from the Body; as when men refuse to communicate in some parts and offices of <hi>Christian Worship,</hi> not in all; or if they refuse Christian Communion, yet set up no <hi>opposite Church</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> of their own. It is not every different Opinion, not every Error or Mistake, not every Quarrel or Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> imagines, which makes a <hi>Schism,</hi> but the Breach of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Communion; and where there is such a Breach, there is certainly a <hi>Schism</hi> on one side or other.</p>
                  <p>The next sort of men Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es with Schism, are the <hi>Sectaries</hi> and <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratists,</hi> and by them he means those, <hi>who 1. appropriate the Church to some nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Sect or Party, which denieth all others to be true Churches, or to have true Ministers or Sacraments.</hi> Upon this Principle, I remember St. <hi>Austin</hi> disputes against
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:204354:76"/> the <hi>Donatists,</hi> who confined the Church of Christ to <hi>Africa,</hi> where their Church was, and to their own Communion, but denied that there was a true Church in any part of the World besides, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here and there some few Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the <hi>Donatists.</hi> Now, this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment certainly extends to all times, as well as to all places; for to appropriate the Church to this last Age, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny all the Churches of the Christian World, for 14 or 15 hundred years, to be true Churches, is a much greater Confinement of the Church, than it is now to appropriate it to any one Sect or Party; and yet, this all those are guilty of, who condem and separate from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Diocesan Episcopacy, Liturgies,</hi> or <hi>indifferent Ceremonies,</hi> unless they can, for 1500 years after the Apostles, shew us a Christian Church, without <hi>Bishops, Liturgies,</hi> or <hi>Ceremonies;</hi> for upon the same Reason, that they separate from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> they are Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks from the whole Christian Church for so many Ages; for I challenge this admirable <hi>Ecclesiastical Historian</hi> to shew me any one Church since the time of the Apostles, wherein there was no <hi>Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>san
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:204354:77"/> Bishops</hi> a more reformed <hi>Liturgy,</hi> and fewer and more <hi>innocent Ceremonies,</hi> than are now in use in the Church of <hi>England:</hi> Nay, if to <hi>appropriate the Church to some narrow Sect and Party, which denieth all others to be true Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, or to have true Ministers or Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> be the Character of a <hi>Schismatick,</hi> both <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independents,</hi> as well as the <hi>Episcopal,</hi> who assert the divine Right and Apostolical Institution of their Churches and Ministry against all other Church-forms of Government, are down right <hi>Schismaticks:</hi> for he that asserts, that there is but one Church of divine Institution, must deny all other Churches or Ministers to be of divine Institution; that is, to be true Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es or Ministers; unless, when Christ has instituted a Church, and a Ministry, there may be true Churches and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, which are not of Christ's Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But of all the <hi>Schismaticks</hi> that ever I heard of, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himself, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to these Principles, did he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, and pursue any, is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, who sets up such a <hi>parochial Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,</hi> which is a compounded Creature of <hi>Presbytery</hi> and <hi>Independency,</hi> as never was practised in any Church yet in the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:204354:77"/> World, which, if he dare stand to it, that this is the only true Apostolical Government, must unchurch all the Churches that ever were in the World.</p>
                  <p>But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is so far out in this Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of a <hi>Schismatick,</hi> that the <hi>quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> to what he says, is the <hi>true Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of a Schismatick,</hi> if it will admit any Notion of Schism. For to assert, that there are more true Churches than one, (how large or narrow soever, the bounds of it be) which were not very large in the first Institution of a Church, and may be reduced again to a narrow Compass by a general Apostacy) is to justifie Schism by a Law; for then there may be distinct Churches, and distinct and opposite Communions without Schism, which is the most <hi>schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Principle</hi> in the World, if Christ have but one Church and one Body, and if breaking the Unity of this Church be Schism; of which more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                  <p>Hence we see, how little Mr. <hi>B.</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands the nature of <hi>Schism,</hi> (I wish he were as ignorant in the Practice of it) when he makes it to consist in <hi>appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priating the Church to some Sect or Party;</hi> that is, to one <hi>Communion,</hi> which is the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:204354:78"/> only <hi>Principle of Christian Ʋnion,</hi> and the denying of it, a <hi>necessary</hi> cause of <hi>Schisms</hi> and <hi>Confusions:</hi> and yet we may observe further, that though this were a <hi>schismatical Principle,</hi> yet nothing makes a man a <hi>Schismatick,</hi> but a sinful Separation from a true Church; and this alone will make a man a <hi>Schismatick,</hi> let his Principles be what they will.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed, Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s next Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of a <hi>Sectarian Schismatick,</hi> is more strange than this, which is expressed in these Words; 2. <hi>And next to those, that though they own others as true Churches or Ministers, yet hold their Communion unlawful, when it is not so, and renounce Communion with them upon these Grounds:</hi> If by <hi>other Churches,</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> means <hi>Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial, Diocesan,</hi> or <hi>national Churches,</hi> who profess the same <hi>Faith,</hi> and live under the same Government and Discipline, unless with such Variety as the time and place, and inevitable necessity of Affairs requires and exacts from them; I say, to separate from, or to deny Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with such true Churches and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, is a Schism; though I believe, no man was ever guilty of it, who held Communion with any Church, unless, <hi>Such People as talk through the Windows
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:204354:78"/> on the West-side of</hi> More-fields, to use Mr. <note place="margin">Third De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. p. 87.</note>
                     <hi>B</hi>'s. elegant Paraphrases, for mad-men: but if by true Churches he means oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site Churches, who set up distinct and separate Communions of their own, which is the Case of the <hi>Presbyterian, Independent,</hi> and other Sectarian Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, who are formed in opposition to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and to one another, as it is plain, he intends it: if these <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent</hi> Parties think the other Churches true Churches, and their Communion lawful, their very dividing into separate Communions is Schism, and they have no other way of justifying their Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but by <hi>holding their Communion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful:</hi> for to renounce a lawful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, when we our selves believe it to be lawful, is certainly a sinful Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, if there be any such thing as Schism; but to renounce a Communion because we believe it unlawful, though it is a Schism, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> truly says, <hi>when it is not so,</hi> (which should make all our <hi>Dissenters</hi> more impartially exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine upon what accounts Communion with the Church of <hi>England</hi> is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful) yet the only Excuse they can pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly make for themselves, is their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake, that they did sincerely believe
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:204354:79"/> such a Communion to be unlawful, when it was not so, and therefore separated; which, how far it shall be accepted, God, who only knows the hearts of men, will judge at the last day.</p>
                  <p>But we must consider, what Mr. <hi>B.</hi> means by <hi>Communion,</hi> when he makes it schismatical for those of opposite Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and Communions, to renounce Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with each other, especially, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Pretence of the Unlawfulness of such Communion: for can a man be a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of two different Churches, which have their distinct and opposite Pastors, Government, Rules of Worship and Discipline? A Member suppose, of the <hi>Episcopal, Presbyterian,</hi> and <hi>Independent</hi> Church, all at one time, what need then can there be, for such distinct Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es? Why do they not all unite into one Church? <hi>Separation</hi> is certainly causless and sinful, when we separate from any Church, with whom we can lawfully communicate, and to communicate with such opposite Churches, either signifies that we are of no Church, or that by Turns we are <hi>Schismaticks</hi> and <hi>Separatists</hi> from them all.</p>
                  <p>But, I suppose, what Mr. <hi>B.</hi> means by <hi>Communion,</hi> is no more but this, That,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:204354:79"/> though men are fixed and setled Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of one particular Church, <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian,</hi> suppose, or <hi>Independent,</hi> yet they may occasionally be present at <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal</hi> Churches, not as <hi>Members,</hi> but to joyn in some <hi>parts of Worship,</hi> or to hear a Sermon; but such occasional presence is very far from being in <hi>Communion</hi> with such a Church, as the <hi>Dean</hi> has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready <note place="margin">Unreas. of Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>p. 107, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> proved, and I shall have occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to discourse more hereafter: and therefore, if Mr. <hi>B.</hi> say true, those are all <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> who believe <hi>Communion</hi> with the <hi>Church of England</hi> to be <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> and yet renounce her <hi>Communion;</hi> that is, refuse to be <hi>Church-members,</hi> and to submit to her Rules of <hi>Worship</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> as if her <hi>Communion</hi> were <hi>unlawful.</hi>
                  </p>

A <hi>passive</hi> Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist is one, who is ejected and silenced, but joyns in publick Worship as far as he can, but does not set up distinct and opposite Churches, and these are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly <hi>meer Non-conformists:</hi> such as the ancient Non-conformists were, who left their Livings, but did not leave the Church, but conformed as Lay-men, though not as publick Ministers; and if he means such, by <hi>meer Non-conformists,</hi> far be it from me to charge them with Schism.</p>

                  <p>But <hi>active Nonconformists</hi> are those, who, though they are ejected, yet will not be silenced, but separate from the Church, and set up Schismatical <hi>Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,</hi> and preach People into Scruples and Factions; and such are the men, whom he describes in the following words, <hi>who declared openly their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments about Doctrine, Worship, and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, in 1660. after a common meeting at</hi> Sion Colledge, <hi>and another at the</hi> Savoy, <hi>which is publish'd in print:</hi> For all these Persons, even Mr. <hi>B.</hi> himself, have actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally separated from the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> if setting up opposite Churches and Conventicles be a Separation; and I could tell him of another meeting, when they secretly declared their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which is not published in print: for, some men, I can assure him, have a publick and a private Conscience; But these, he sayes, <hi>are the Reconcilers, or Peace-makers, who then laboured and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for Peace and Ʋnity in vain;</hi> that is, who were very desirous of Union, if they could have had it upon their own terms; And, I think all Conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ists and Non-conformists whatsoever, <hi>passive</hi> or <hi>active,</hi> are such kind of Peace-makers and Reconcilers as these, though

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:204354:82"/> Non-conformists heretofore, Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Independents,</hi> &amp;c. This I confess is true, they have forsaken the Principles of the old Non-conformists, who were true <hi>passive Non-conformists,</hi> who lived peaceably in the Communion of the Church, and confuted the <hi>Separatists</hi> of those days, and the <hi>meer Non-conformists</hi> of our days; and therefore, it was high time to quit their Principles, and if they were honest, they should not glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in their names neither.

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:204354:83"/> Word of God, and the example of the true Primitive Churches:</hi> As for the Word of God, he knows very well, that this is pretended on all sides, right or wrong; the <hi>Episcopal, Presbyterian, Independent</hi> Churches, all pretend a <hi>Jus divinum;</hi> but when he adds, <hi>And the Example of the true Primitive Churches,</hi> if there be no Fallacy in it, he must be ours: for <hi>Episcopacy</hi> is the only Government ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Word of God, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by Primitive Practise, as I must believe, till he can shew me a <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> or <hi>Independent</hi> Church, in the Ages next after the Apostles. For, if by the true Primitive Churches, he means only the Churches in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles days, he does not deal sincerely in distinguishing the Word of God, from the Example of the true Primitive Churches; for there is no way to know what the Churches in the Apostles time were, but by the Word of God; that is, the Historical Account we have of it in Scripture, which, it seems, is not so plain, but the differing Parties can put their own Fancies on it, and wrangle about the Signification of those names, <hi>Bishops, Presbyter,</hi> and <hi>Deacon.</hi> But, if we will suppose that Government which
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:204354:83"/> the Apostles instituted, was continued and preserved in those true Primitive Churches, which immediately succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Age of the Apostles, (which is but very reasonable to think) then the whole matter is very plain, that <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy</hi> is an Apostolical Institution, not a <hi>Parochial Independent,</hi> but a true <hi>Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>san Canoneering Episcopacy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For a Conclusion of this Character of the <hi>meer present Non-conformist,</hi> he adds, <hi>And are not for Concord only with a Sect, or a dividing Party, high or low, but for that Catholick Church, and Communion of Saints, which are in our Creed.</hi> This is surprizing! What he means by <hi>Concord,</hi> I cannot tell; but, when he speaks of Church <hi>Concord,</hi> he ought to mean Communion, and then by his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, he and his Brethren are for holding Church-Communion with Sects and dividing Parties; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if any of these Sects, and dividing Parties are <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> he is so too; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he can communicate in <hi>Schism,</hi> without being a <hi>Schismatick:</hi> and, it is strange, if none of the dividing Parties should be <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> or that he should escape the guilt of <hi>Schism,</hi> who counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances all, by communicating with all;
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:204354:84"/> an admirable way to <hi>Catholick Ʋnity:</hi> here is Latitudinarianism with a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                  <p>But, still they are <hi>for the Catholick Church, and Communion of Saints, which are in our Creed,</hi> and, truly there it must keep according to these Principles; for it is never likely to be seen in the World, where we have such <hi>meer Non-conformists</hi> among us.

Now, I must confess, I know not how to deal with Mr. <hi>B.</hi> here; for, he has, of late days, pitched upon a very cunning way of Writing, not by Reasons and Arguments, and a fair debate of the case in Difference, but by stating Cases, and giving Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:204354:84"/> Accounts of their Judgment and Opinions, and Practises, without draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Inference, but leaving his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to make Application, according to their own Fancies and Interests; and then if you apply any thing he says, to the Business of <hi>Non-conformity,</hi> or <hi>Schism,</hi> and shew, that there is no force at all in it, you are presently answered with a <hi>Mentiris,</hi> in <hi>English,</hi> you lie Sir, as they say, one confuted <hi>Bellarmine</hi> of old: that is, he will state a case, as he calls it, by heaping up all the vilest and most spiteful Insinuations, that can be thought on, to bespatter the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and present Constitutions in Church and State; but these must not be called the Reasons of his Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, but an History of matter of Fact, which are not his Reasons, till he has formed them into Mode and Figure: and now, whoever goes to answer him, and produces these as his Reasons of Non-conformity, is turn'd off with a <hi>Mentiris,</hi> for fear of <hi>tiring his Readers, by turning a Mentiris</hi> (or an <hi>English Lie) into a civil long Parenthesis.</hi> Thus he has served the <hi>Impleader</hi> of his <hi>Plea for</hi>

                     <hi>Peace,</hi> and, thus he says, he has served some others, <hi>but has forborne it with others
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:204354:85"/> far more guilty, least their Reverence and Power, should make truth intolerable, whose Passion or Interest, or Error, had made gross Lies seem true and necessary.</hi> We may easily guess, what Reverend Person he means, and I am afraid, his Civility to him has lost his Cause, for he will never be able to give him a more convincing Answer, while his Eyes are open.</p>
                  <p>This is really and truly a great piece of Art, and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ought to have the Glory of the Invention; for by this means, he effectually promotes his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, which is to load the Church of <hi>England</hi> with Reproaches, and to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their Schism among their own Party, who understand their Cant; and if any busie pragmatical Scribler, as I may be at this time, shall venture to answer him, there is nothing to be answered, but his <hi>Historical Mistakes:</hi> for he will allow no body to turn his History into Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, but himself; who will be sure never to do it, or his trusty Friends, who will be sure to like them; and one good graceful <hi>Mentiris,</hi> or we will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him twenty or thirty, because he can seldom stop under, shall be an un-answerable Answer to all his Implead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.

When men argue from mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Fact, the matter of Fact must be one Term in the Syllogism, and if mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact be not part of the Argument, it is impertinent and trifling: As for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, if we should frame an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thus,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>We must not submit to sinful Terms of Communion, but renouncing the Covenant, owning the Authority of Diocesan Bishops, using the Liturgy, and any symbolical Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>are sinful Terms of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:</hi> Ergo, <hi>We must not submit to them.</hi>

                  <p>And therefore, he who gives an <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storical Account</hi> of the Terms of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and his Scruples about it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as a beginning of an Answer to that Question, Why do you not conform? must be supposed to alledge these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Fact, as the Basis and Foundation of his Reason, if he will be so nice, as not to call it a Reason; for, if it be no part of his Reason, it is nothing to the purpose, no more than the Adventures of some Knight Errant.</p>
                  <p>The same Method he has taken in his <hi>Search</hi> for the <hi>English Schismatick;</hi> he has <hi>not determined who he is, but made a pair of Spectacles for the purblind to see it,</hi> and this he has done by stating the case of the <hi>Diocesan Canoneers,</hi> and <hi>the meer present Non-conformists.</hi> No doubt, but he intends to prove the Diocesan Canoneers, to be <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> for I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think, he designs to prove himself to be one, and, therefore he has stated their case, in a hundred and four Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, which is the Indictment against them, to prove them to be <hi>Schismaticks;</hi> and yet I greatly suspect, that whoever shall examine all these Particulars, and shew, that they are either false as to matter of Fact, or that they will not

                  <p>The first Head of Accusation is, That we have a great many different Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons among our selves; as 1. <hi>About the essentiating Head of our own national Church. 2.

                  <p>Now, all these he calls <hi>Schisms among</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Search for Sch. p. 25.</note>
                     <hi>themselves, which are too many to be here numbred;</hi> that is, That all men who differ in their private Opinions, are <hi>Schismaticks</hi> from one another, though they live in the same Communion, and preserve the Unity of the Spirit in the bond of Peace. But this is a perfect Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick Notion of Schism, agreeable to their Practice, who divide the Church for every trifling Difference in Opinion, and is a plain Argument, that even such a flinty Soul, as his Encomiast says Mr. B. has, has it's obtuse and blind, as well as it's acute and light-striking side.</p>
                  <p>And, therefore I shall first mind him, that his admired Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> himself, will not allow Schism to consist in differing Opinions, but in the erecting a new Church and Oratory, for the dividing Party to meet in publickly (the exact case of our meer Non-conforming Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratists)
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:204354:87"/> as in the late famous Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie in <hi>Holland, de Praedestinatione</hi> (which Mr. B. instances in, and, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his dividing Faculty, distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es into as many Heads, as he could think on) as long as the disagreeing Parties, went no farther than Disputes; the Schism was unhatched, but as soon as one Party swept an old Cloyster, and, by a pretty Art, made it a Church, (by putting a new Pulpit in it) for the sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating Party to meet in, what before was a Controversie, became a formal Schism.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I would desire him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that according to this Principle, there never was a Church in the World, at least, not in these last inquisitive Ages, but was made up of Schismaticks, not his own beloved Catholick spirited Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles excepted; for excepting some few Dreams and Fancies of his own, (which never troubled any man's Head, till he put them in) these controverted Doctrines, which he here mentions, have always been disputed, and will be so to the end of the World, and these men, who glory in Conquest, and affect to be the Heads of Parties, or place Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion more in Orthodox Opinions, than
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:204354:88"/> in the Virtues of a Christian Life; sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate upon this account, and turn for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Schismaticks. Are not all these Disputes as hotly managed among Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters, as among the Episcopal Clergy? (witness the Dispute about Mr. B's. <hi>Aphorisms of Justification, John Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win's Redemption redeemed,</hi> and the late rude Assaults made upon Mr. <hi>How)</hi> and why then, was not this put into the Case of the meer Non-conformists, as well as the Diocesan Canoneers? I will not tell the Reason, but every Body may guess it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if he had dealt fairly, he should have told us, which of these dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Parties had been the Schismaticks; for, if two distinct men, or Parties of men, hold contradictory Opinions, and this is schismatical, both these cannot be Schismaticks, unless both parts of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction be true, or Truth it self will make a man a Schismatick, if it should happen, that another man holds a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Error: this Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> did not dare meddle with, least he should have cleared his Diocesan Canoneers, and cast the Schism upon his meer Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Brethren, who are not many of them, of his mind in these matters.</p>

                  <p>Fourthly, I fear, according to this Principle, Mr. B. will be found the greatest Schismatick in nature; for there are very few men in the World, that agree with him, or he with them: nay, some say, that he has very often been a Schismatick to himself, and very sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom agrees long together with his own Judgment.</p>
                  <p>And fifthly, to take notice at present of no other particular Accusation, his first Charge is very pleasant, <hi>They agree not of the essentiating Head of their own national Church, whether it be Lay or Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, King or Bishop, (and so are, indeed, of divers Churches) no, nor whether it have any constitutive Head or none.</hi> This is a most ridiculous Conceit of Mr. B. as you shall hear more hereafter; but, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the thing were true, that we were not agreed about these matters, how does this prove us to be of divers Churches, when we all communicate in the same Church, and in the same holy Offices, and give all that Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the King in Ecclesiastical matters, which Christian Kings and Princes have ever enjoyed, and which our Laws grant him, and pay that Reverence and Subjection to Bishops, which is due to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:204354:89"/> them by Catholick Practice, and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Canons, and the present Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions of our Church? But, because we cannot agree about the meaning of a cramp, metaphysical Term (which it may be, has no meaning) <hi>An essential constitutive Head,</hi> therefore we must be of divers Churches, which is just like the wise Dispute about the principle of Individuation, which at this rate of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing, must make Mr. B. as many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers men (setting aside the diversity of his Opinions) as there are different Judgments about it: or, to put a plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er case than this, because there are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Opinions of the Subjects of this Realm, about the nature of it's Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, whether the King, suppose, be one of the three Estates, or a Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Head to them all; therefore the men who differ in their Opinions about these matters, do not belong to the same, but to divers Kingdoms. If Mr. B. will not blush at this, I will blush for him; and, how parallel this Case is, will appear from considering his second head of Accusations, which concern the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Opinions about Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which he says, were entertain'd by Church men, above forty years ago,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:204354:89"/>
                     <hi>about Prerogative, Laws, and Property, 19. &amp;c.</hi> And, from hence he takes oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to give an account of the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of our late Civil Wars, which is not my Business at present to consider, but I leave that to those, who are concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to prevent another. But cannot men differ about Civil Government, but they must be Schismaticks from the Church, as well as Rebels against the State? If there be different Opinions among Churchmen, about these matters, who live still in the Communion of the same Church, how does this make them Schismaticks? Is it made a necessary term of Church-Communion, to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Dispute about Prerogative, Laws, and Property? Or, is the Church of <hi>England</hi> schismatical, because it as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts a just Obedience to Government, and has always been Loyal to Princes? I beseech you Sir, tell us, which Party of these differing Diocesan Canoneers were the Schismaticks, and then we may guess, which were the Rebels too; there were indeed, in those days, a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>active Canoneering Diocesans,</hi> (if we will believe Mr. <hi>B.</hi> who says, the War was begun by Conformists) whom now he modesty calls <hi>passive Conformists;</hi> and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:204354:90"/> I pray God, they may never come to be <hi>active</hi> again.</p>
                  <p>A third Charge, are the differing practices among us in several Churches, which, though we all joyn in the same Communion, yet, it seems, proves us to be Schismatick; <hi>That some only, are for bidding Prayer in the Pulpit, others use Prayer there, 93. Some pray in their own Words, and some in the words of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, some use the same words, and others vary them.</hi> 94. Now, is not this an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable way of proving men Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks? if there be one certain Rule for this, some of these men break that Rule, and are lyable to the Censures of their Superiours, but certainly, they are not Schismaticks, who own the Authority, and submit to the Discipline, and live in Communion with the Church. But, <hi>one is for Altars and Rails, and others against them, and others for Indifferency 98.</hi> And is this made a term of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion or any part of Conformity, or determined either way by the Church? But, <hi>in preaching, they use very different Methods;</hi> somewhat better I confess, than are generally used in Conventicles; but does the Church confine us to any one? Or, may we not take that Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:204354:90"/> which the Church gives? <hi>And, some Churches of them begin to use new versions of the singing Psalms. 99.</hi> This is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertency or Mistake (to use a civil Parenthesis for once) and a sign, how little they frequent our Churches, or how little they mind what is done there: for he cannot name any one Church, which does so, unless he will call the private Chappel of the <hi>Charter-house,</hi> a Church: but however, singing Psalms it self, is no part of the prescribed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, but only the connivance of Authority. But what a happy case are those men in, who can preach and pray as they list, and sing what Psalms they please, without danger of Schism? if such little things as these can make a Schismatick, it is strange to me, that Separation it self should be no Schism.</p>
                  <p>But, <hi>Their Cathedral Worship much differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from the Parochial, and some Churches use Organs, and others have none. 95.</hi> Wherein does this Difference consist? Have the Cathedral Churches, another Liturgy, than is used in Parochial Churches? Is there any other difference than is allowed of? May not the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Psalms be either said or sung? Does not the Rubrick take notice of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:204354:91"/> Hymns, and appoint, when they shall be sung? Is it a different Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, if the Litany be read in the Desk or in the Body of the Quire, and the Communion Service, at the Altar? And when the singing <hi>English</hi> Psalms in meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, is only connived at, not enjoyned, does it make a schismatical Difference, to sing with Organs, or without? How vastly do these men differ from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves! If the Church commands any <hi>indifferent Ʋsages</hi> in religious Worship, it is so great a Violation of Christian Liberty, that it justifies their Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but on the other hand, if she leave any thing at Liberty, and men use that Liberty which is given them, it is so great a Disorder, that it makes those Schismaticks, who live like Brethren in the same Communion.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, another great Charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst these <hi>Diocesan Canoneers,</hi> are those <hi>Church Impositions,</hi> which are so heavy and intolerable a burden to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Consciences, and force those who desire Peace and Unity, to be at least <hi>meer Non-conformists;</hi> and if this Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration be a Schism, those are guilty of the Schism, who cause the Separation, not those who separate: to this purpose,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:204354:91"/> he heaps together a great many things required in Conformity, and some not required, which make up the greatest part of those hundred and four Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, which yet remain to be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; where we find things so unfairly represented, with such spiteful and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuous Insinuations against our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours and Government, that it is too plain a Proof, how inconsistent a rash, furious Zeal is with moral Hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty; as to take notice of some few things very briefly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>N.</hi> 25. he says, <hi>The Convocation cast away the King's Declaration, and drew up the Changes in the Liturgy, which add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to our Burden.</hi> This was very boldly done, if it were true, and I wonder the King was never heard to complain of the Affront: but, I find this Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion serves all Purposes; when they have a mind to libell the King, then he flung away his Declaration himself, and is not to be trusted any more; but when they would make the Church schismatical, then the <hi>Convocation cast it away,</hi> and not only so, <hi>but they drew the Parliament to confirm it all:</hi> And, what a wise People were they, who choose such a Parliament, as would be thus
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:204354:92"/> wheadled by a Convocation? but, the Truth is, that Parliament had a fresh Sense of the miseries of our late Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and the wild and ungovernable Temper of Fanaticism, which made them think it necessary, to restore and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish the Loyal and Suffering Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>N.</hi> 26. As for their next Grievance, the <hi>Corporation Oath,</hi> that does not concern the Church, but the Security of the State; and it is extreamly modest in these men, to quarrel at a Prince, whose Father was murdered, and he himself banished, by vertue of a solemn League and Covenant, that he will not admit such persons into Offices of Trust, who will not renounce it: especially, this was an unseasonable Objection at this time of day, when he sees, that his tender conscienced Dissenters, have learned the Knack of expounding such Oaths, and taking them, to serve some Turn, they best know what: especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, considering, that as sacred as they now think the Covenant, time was, when the Engagement laid it aside.</p>
                  <p>His next Objections, or whatever he will call them, concern the <hi>Cross in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, 27. God-fathers and God-mothers,</hi>
                     <pb n="93" facs="tcp:204354:92"/> 28. <hi>Kneeling at Sacrament, 29. Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation by Episcopal Imposition of hands,</hi> 30. I hear nothing now of that good old Objection, the symbolical Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of a Marriage-ring, for there are none of them so scrupulous, but they can digest hearing the Common-Prayer, and twenty Ceremonies, rather than not be married; especially, when there is a good Estate, which cannot be made sure in Law, without it; and could they not be legally married, till they were confirmed by the Bishop, and had received the Sacrament kneeling, and engaged to baptize their Children with the Sign of the <hi>Cross,</hi> and with God-fathers and God-mothers, the Dispute were at an end. We can remember, since no man, who had a good gainful Office, scrup'led receiving the Lord's Supper kneeling; and, methinks after all their Pretences of Doubts and Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that is a very odd kind of tender Conscience, which will venture to be damned, to get, or to save an Estate, but is extreamly fearful and timorous, when any thing is to be done for the Peace and Unity, and good Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church.</p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:204354:93"/>
                  <p>Another great Quarrel he has, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst those Canons, which excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate them, who reproach the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished Church and Worship, or the thirty nine Articles, or the Rites and Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as superstitious, or condemn the Form of making and consecrating Bishops, Priests, and Deacons, as repugnant to the Word of God: <hi>N.</hi> 32, 33, 34, 35, 36. And what is the fault of these Canons? Is it not fit for every Church to secure her Government, Doctrine, Worship, from the Lashes of every petulant Tongue? if they do not like these things, yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not they forbear to reproach and vilifie them? Is this part of that Liberty of Conscience they desire, to burlesque the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and expose it to Contempt? Yes. This is what they perpetually do, and are angry at the Church, that she will not give them Leave to do it; for, should they only modestly dissent, and not reproach the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the People would see no Hurt in those things they quarrel at, and then farewel to Conventicles and Fanaticism. But, we must never expect to see Church or State, or the Reputation of the most innocent and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:204354:93"/> virtuous men, secure, till there be a severe Restraint laid upon mens Tongues and Pens.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>N.</hi> 64. He says, <hi>They excommunicate all Ministers, that voluntarily relinquish their Calling, and use themselves as Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and yet thousands must do both, if the Bishops silence them.</hi> And, is there no Difference between deserting an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and being deposed by Authority? Between a Servant's running away from his Master, and being turned out of Doors for his ill Manners, Disobedience, and ungovernable Temper? If Mr. <hi>B.</hi> does not understand this Difference, I hope others will see, what value they are to have for his Judgment; and, least he should want Objections, he looks back to those times, which he will not allow us to think on, <hi>The new Canons, and Et-Caetera Oath in 1640. brought in without the Parliament,</hi> which is all the Objections he makes against them, though that be a popular Cheat; for, had they been brought in with the Parliament, he would have liked them never the better, nor excused the Church ever the more; for then, as we heard above, it had been as great a fault to <hi>draw in the Parliament to confirm them
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:204354:94"/> all,</hi> as to bring them in without them.</p>
                  <p>Thus all the Silencings and Prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Protestant Dissenters in Q. <hi>El.</hi> and King <hi>James</hi>'s days, are charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Church, and the <hi>dancing-book</hi> is a good Argument to this day. 396. 8. 69. To what purpose is all this? Do these things, which were done in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages, but are not done now, make us Schismaticks, or justifie their Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Then he reckons up a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particular things, which are impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed on those who will conform; and that he may not want numbers, he brings over again the Cross in Baptism, and kneeling at the Sacrament, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as imposed on Ministers in these Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations, without which, they must neither baptize nor give the Sacrament. <hi>N.</hi> 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51. and in <hi>N.</hi> 52. to give us a Tast of his Honesty, and how impossible it is, for such men to want Arguments, he is guilty of such a Falsification, as, if it be an ignorant mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake, ought to make him less confident another time; if it be willful, should teach other men to be less confident of him: his Words are these, <hi>They must profess Consent and Practise to pronounce all that they bury to be TAKEN TO GOD
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:204354:94"/> IN MERCY, WHERE WE HOPE TO COME,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>(except only the Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, unbaptized, and Self-murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers) were they Atheists or Prophane.</hi> Now, if there be any such words in the Office of Burial, as <hi>taken to God in Mercy, where we hope to come,</hi> I will yield the Cause; but the Fraud is this, he has taken the first part of the Sentence from the words that are pronounced at the interring the Corps, and has made up the other part, not of the words (tho he has put them into the <hi>Italick</hi> Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, as the words of the Common-Prayer) but from the Sense of an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression in the Collect after the Burial, and has joyned them together, as if they were one entire Sentence in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer, and made one entire Sense: whereas, these words which he has thus tacked together, have a very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Sense and Interpretation, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the different manner of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing used in each. In the first part, the Church is very positive, <hi>It has pleased Almighty God, of his great Mercy, to take unto himself, the Soul of our dear Brother here departed;</hi> But, in the Collect, it is only matter of Hope, and the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Charity, <hi>That when we depart
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:204354:95"/> this Life, we may rest in him, as our Hope is, this our Brother doth.</hi> Now, if our Church mean the same thing, by <hi>God's taking to himself the Soul of our dear Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in great Mercy,</hi> and <hi>our resting in him;</hi> Why does she in one place pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily assert it, without any doubt and hesitancy, and in the other place, express only some hope of it? But, I find Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is still to learn the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between <hi>God's taking our Souls to himself in great Mercy,</hi> and taking them <hi>to his Mercy:</hi> The first signifies no more, than that God takes them to his own Tribunal, to be judged by himself, and not to leave them to the unjust Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men or Devils: which we must acknowledge to be great Mercy, to stand before a just, and equal, and most merciful Tribunal, where all the unjust Sentences, which men pass against one another, shall be reversed, and their Cause heard over again. But, to take any man to his Mercy, is to absolve, acquit, and reward him, so that we are not bound to assent, that Atheists and profane men go to Heaven, but to hope charitably of those, who live and die in the Communion of the Church; and if for want of the due Exercise of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:204354:95"/> any bad men die in Church-Communion, some men do not think themselves bound to use those words; which suppose the Exercise of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. However, these are different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Hope, and though we can have very little hope of some Persons, yet, unless we are absolutely sure, that they died final Impenitents, which, in most Cases, is impossible for us to know, we are not without all hope of very bad men: at least, we may have as much hope of them, as of Self-murderers, of whom I remember Mr. <hi>B.</hi> somewhere speaks with great Favour, though they die in the willful Commission of the most barbarous and unnatural Sin, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Repentance.</p>
                  <p>If this, at best, sounds ill at the Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals of bad men, to say, that God hath, in great Mercy, taken to himself, their Souls, when we know, that according to the Terms of the Gospel, they must be condemned to endless Punishments; we must consider, that there is Mercy, even in Judgment, and if we believe, that there are different degrees of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment in the other World, propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to the Nature of mens Sins, and that God our Judge, will make all fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:204354:96"/> Allowances, which any man's case will bear; we must acknowledge it an act of Mercy, for God to judge us himself, and not to leave us to the Will of evil and merciless Spirits: as when <hi>David</hi> was put to that hard Choice, <hi>Shall seven years of Famine come unto thee in thy Land? Or wilt thou flie three Months before thy Enemies, while they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue thee? Or, that there be three days Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilence in thy Land? David</hi> answers, <hi>Let us fall now into the hand of the Lord (for his Mercies are great) and let me not fall into the hand of man. 2 Sam.</hi> 24. 13. 14. And if the Mercy of God, even when he punishes so severely, be a just Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to choose to fall into the hand, the immediate disposal of God, rather than into the hands of men, then we have Reason to bless God, that he will be our Judge, and not leave us to the Will and Lust of cruel and implacable Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Non-conformists Advocate,</hi> in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer <note place="margin">p. 27, 28.</note> to this, seems to deny a great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of our Faith, that Christ is the Judge of the Quick and of the Dead, of good and bad men; that because the Devil takes such men Captive, while they live, therefore he is their Judge
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:204354:96"/> after Death too. <hi>That the Devil had, and has still, the Power of Death, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of all impenitent Sinners, as the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifex or Executioner, has Power over all those who are condemned to die:</hi> But what before they are condemned man? Then he is judge too, as well as Executioner: but, if as he adds, <hi>They be put into his hands, that the Sentence may be actually fulfilled,</hi> then it seems, the Sentence is past before they are put into the Devil's hand, and that is as much as we desire; that not the Devil, but God, may have the passing of the Sentence, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil have no Power to execute any other Sentence, than what God passes; and yet he knows not how to believe, <hi>That abominable wicked Workers go immediately</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Non Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Adv. p. 29.</note>
                     <hi>after Death into the hands of the great God to be disposed of by him according to the promises of the Gospel-Covenant.</hi> But, he might, and must believe this, if he add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Conditions</hi> too, as he ought to have done, if he intended to represent the Sense either of Dr. <hi>Faulkner,</hi> or his Transcriber, as he is pleased to call him; or else he must deny that bad men shall be judged by the Gospel, or that Christ is the Judge of bad men.</p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:204354:97"/>
                  <p>But let this Expression of <hi>God's ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Souls of bad men in Mercy to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> be never so hard (tho our Church never intended it should be applied to notorious bad men) yet, certainly it is much harder, to affix such a Sense upon it, as is directly contrary to the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and avowed Doctrine of the Church. If he can find, that the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in her Articles or Homilies, gives Encouragement to notorious bad men without Repentance to expect Mercy from God, he may then, without breach of Charity, expound her Prayers to this Sense: but if she teaches quite the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, we cannot think, that she has one Rule of Doctrine in the profession of her Faith, another for the exercise of her Devotions.</p>
                  <p>The Truth is, this Office of Burial is an excellent Office, supposing the due exercise of Church Discipline, to cast all notorious Sinners and Schismaticks, out of the Communion of the Church: which the Church supposes to be done, when she commands us to use this form of Words, and enjoyns, that <hi>then the Preist shall say,</hi> &amp;c. as this Advocate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 30.</note> And thus we subscribe it, as a proper Office for the Burial of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:204354:97"/> who are fit to live in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church; the want of this case in exercising Discipline, raises some Scruples, as to Practice, when these words are applied to bad men, who, though they died in the Communion of the Church, yet did not deserve to do so: and, I wish with all my Heart, that some Expressions were altered, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any Scandal to the scrupulous, or to the prophane, or, which is more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireable, that Discipline were revived, which would soon answer all these Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections.</p>
                  <p>But, yet there is one thing more to be said in this matter, which though it be not ordinarily taken notice of, seems to me to be of great Moment, and justifies what I before said concerning that Liberty, which every Minister may take in omitting such Passages, as our Dissenters except against in the Burial of Papists, Schismaticks, or incorrigible Sinners.</p>
                  <p>By the Rubrick excommunicate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are excepted from Christian Burial; now, there are two sorts of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications allowed in our Church, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicatio sub judice,</hi> and <hi>latae Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae;</hi> The first is, when men are formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:204354:98"/> excommunicated by the Ecclesiastical Judge; the second is that which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> so often talks of, the Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication <hi>Ipso facto,</hi> when, by the Canons of the Church, a man who is guilty of such Offences as are there spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, is declared to be Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, before any judicial Sentence passes on him. Now, the Rubrick, which forbids the Burial of excommunicated persons, does not confine this to any one sort of Excommunication: and therefore if a Minister, either in visiting the Sick, or by any other means, finds any man under this Sentence, though not actually inflicted on him by an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Judge, yet he may, by vertue of this Rubrick, refuse to bury him by that Form prescribed in our Liturgy, because, by the Canons of the Church, he is under the Sentence of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication. This Authority is expressly allowed the Minister, in repelling those from the Communion of the <hi>Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> who are <hi>notorious and open evil Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;</hi> and the same Reason holds in the Office of Burial, but this I submit to the Judgment of my Superiours.</p>
                  <p>But, to proceed, <hi>N.</hi> 53. They <hi>must declare Assent to a false Rule for finding
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:204354:98"/> Easter-day, and consent to keep two Easters, often, yea, though it be confessed false.</hi> Some Learned men are not so confident, that Rule is <hi>false,</hi> as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> seems to be; to be sure it does not often fail, as he insinuates; and others think that we do not give our <hi>Assent</hi> and <hi>Consent</hi> to it, because we are not confined to the Use of it, the <hi>Church</hi> having given another Rule which never fails; and we may use which we please. The thing to be done is, to find out <hi>Easter-day;</hi> and if we have a certain Rule for that, which is <hi>alwayes true,</hi> and another which is so <hi>generally true,</hi> that if there be any Defect in it, it was not discovered till of late dayes, that is a mighty squeamish Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science that strains at such Gnats as these; and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> shall have the glory of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a second <hi>Paschal Schism</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> upon much more trifling Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, than occasioned the first. We do not give our Assent to every Saying in the <hi>Common-Prayer Book,</hi> but to every thing which is <hi>contained in, and prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by it,</hi> that is, what we are bound to use, and there being two Rules given for the finding <hi>Easter,</hi> without confining us to the Use of either, we may use which we will, and so are not bound to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:204354:99"/> use that which happens to be <hi>false,</hi> but that which is <hi>true.</hi> But, to <hi>assent,</hi> as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> does, if there be any Force in this <hi>Exception,</hi> that we are bound to use them both, and hence conclude, that we give our consent to keep two <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi> often, when the Church's Design in both their Rules, is, to find out but one <hi>Easter,</hi> (or else neither of the Rules can ever be false) is an Argument of great Ingenuity, and great Modesty, and a very <hi>peaceable Design:</hi> and yet, if this be the worst of it, I would rather keep ten <hi>Easters</hi> every year, than be a <hi>Schismatick;</hi> unless the Church should command me to believe, that Christ, who <hi>rose</hi> from the <hi>dead</hi> but <hi>once,</hi> rose on two or three several dayes: and there is no danger of this, for we do not observe <hi>Easter,</hi> as the precise time of Christ's <hi>Resurrection,</hi> no more than the <hi>Jews</hi> did the Feast of the <hi>Passeover.</hi> And now I think of it, I can tell Mr. <hi>B.</hi> a more material Objection than this, from the difference of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Stile,</hi> by which means, all the Churches, which follow the <hi>New Stile,</hi> as <hi>Holland, France, Spain, Italy, &amp;c.</hi> Protestants as well as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, observe <hi>Easter</hi> ten dayes before our <hi>English Easter,</hi> and many Merchants, who
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:204354:99"/> have come out of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> after their <hi>Easter,</hi> have come time enough into <hi>England,</hi> to be guilty of that horrid Sin of keeping two <hi>Easters</hi> in a year: if Mr. <hi>B.</hi> will but set his Wits to work about this, he may improve it into as notable a Controversie, as that of old was of the <hi>Quarto-Decimani,</hi> and then let him alone to turn it into a <hi>Schism.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>N.</hi> 55. He endeavours to put new Scruples into Peoples heads, about that Declaration, <hi>That it is not lawful, on any pretence whatsoever, to take Arms against those commissionated by the King.</hi> These are <hi>his</hi> words, for there is no such Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in the Declaration which is print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Ʋniformity,</hi> the words of which are these; <hi>It is not lawful, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any pretence whatsoever, to take Arms against the King; and that I do abhorr that traiterous Position of taking Arms by his Authority against his Person, or against those that are commissionated by him.</hi> There seems to be some difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s words, and the words of the Declaration; for it is <hi>unlawful</hi> to take Arms, upon any pretence, against the King, but the <hi>Declaration</hi> does not say, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> does, <hi>that it is unlawful, upon any Pretence, to take Arms against
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:204354:100"/> those commissionated by the King:</hi> If their Commission be legal and good, it is then as unlawful to resist them, as to resist the King; but if, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> puts the case, their Commission be <hi>illegal, fraudulent, extorted</hi> from him, these are reasonable and just <hi>pretences,</hi> when they are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainly known, to resist such men, though it is never lawful to take Arms against the King: and therefore Mr. <hi>B.</hi> did not do well (for I will at present say no worse of it) to apply those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusive terms, (on which his whole Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is founded) <hi>upon any pretence whatsoever,</hi> to those <hi>commissionated by the King,</hi> which the Declaration applies only <hi>to the King himself.</hi> And, methinks, it was not wisely done neither, when the Brethren had set out their Explication of such kind of Declarations, and were in a hopeful way of getting the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of all Corporations into their hands, which would be greatly serviceable to the Cause, to furbish up some old, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worn Objections, to trouble their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, which may deprive us of godly &amp; well-affected Magistrates for ever after.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>N.</hi> 56. Another great Grievance is, <hi>that none must preach that subscribeth not, that (there lieth no obligation from the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:204354:100"/> Oath called the Covenant, on him, or any other Person, to endeavour any Change or Alteration of Church-Government) though many hundred thousands took that Oath whom we know not, nor their sense.</hi> What then? Truly, I can't tell where the Force of this Objection lies, unless it be in this, that we cannot say, <hi>that no man is obliged, by the Covenant, unless we knew his sense, whether he thinks himself obliged or not:</hi> as if there were no difference between the obligation of an Oath, in it self considered, and that obligation which a mistaken Opinion and errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Conscience layes upon men? as if the Parliament commanded us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what mens Thoughts and secret Judgments are, not what they ought to be, considering the Intrinsick nature and obligation of such an Oath? as if I could not say, that there lay no obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon <hi>Herod</hi> to cut off <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist</hi>'s head, because, it seems, he thought there was? But he adds, <hi>and so all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of Church-Government is made unlawful and impossible, though vowed.</hi> I beseech you Sir, is there no difference between the Change and Alteration of the Government of the Church by Arch-bishops, Bishops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which was
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:204354:101"/> the Matter of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of any Defects in the Disei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline or Government of the Church? Is there no difference between pulling up the Foundation of a House, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king some such Alterations in particular Rooms and Offices, as may be for the greater Ornament and Use? Was there no obligation to reform the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Solemn League and Covenant?</hi> and do not the same Obligations conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, though the Covenant be taken away? How then does the renouncing an <hi>illegal Covenant</hi> to pull down the <hi>Church,</hi> make it <hi>unlawful</hi> and <hi>impossible</hi> to reform it?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>N.</hi> 66. He complains, that <hi>the Parish Priest</hi> (a name which we are not asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of, though often spoken in derision and scorn by him) <hi>must publish Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muncations, though against his Conscience, against godly men, for not conforming.</hi> I suppose he speaks of some <hi>passive Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists,</hi> for the <hi>Diocesan Canoneers</hi> don't use to act against their Consciences, nor make any scruple of excommunicating <hi>godly Schismaticks,</hi> who first excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate themselves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>N.</hi> 63. <hi>Ordination enableth no man to preach, without farther License.</hi> And thus
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:204354:101"/> it was in the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> where no <hi>Presbyters</hi> were allowed to preach, or administer the Eucharist in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop's presence, nor in his absence, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his leave and Licence. Our <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> (as appears in the Form of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination) gives us Authority to preach, which is a general Qualification; the Bishop's Licence determines the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of our Ministry to a certain place; and these are two different things, as those know, who are skilled in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Practice of the Church.</p>
                  <p>These are the principal <hi>Impositions</hi> he complains of, which make them <hi>Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists,</hi> and the Church and Church-men <hi>Schismaticks.</hi> He mentions some others, without giving the least insinuation, what fault he finds with them, and, of all men I know, I will not undertake to guess at Mr. <hi>B's</hi> Reasons.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, to bring this matter, about <hi>Impositions,</hi> to a short issue: <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions</hi> signifie no more than those terms of <hi>Communion,</hi> which are enjoyned and commanded to be observed by all the Members of our Church; and if it be <hi>unlawful</hi> in it self to make any Laws and Rules of <hi>Communion,</hi> and to command the Observation of them; then either

                     </note> Church must be <hi>Schismatical,</hi> who refuses such Members as will not submit to its peculiar Laws and Rules; and then all the Churches, that I know of, are so: the <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> who require all men to submit to their mixt Tribunal of their Ministers and Lay-Elders; the <hi>Independent,</hi> who require an explicit <hi>Church-Covenant;</hi> and Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self was a very great <hi>Schismatick,</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in exacting Conformity to that Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline which he set up in <hi>Geneva,</hi> but in exhorting the Lord Protector, in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Reign, to impose Articles of <hi>Faith,</hi> and a Form of <hi>Catechising,</hi> and a <hi>Liturgy,</hi> upon all the Bishops and Ministers of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> from which it should not be lawful for them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede (nay, which, as far as concerns mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Doctrine) they should be bound, by an express Oath, to observe; and no man should be capable of any Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Office, who refused it.</p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:204354:102"/>
                  <p>And, if it be not unlawful for our Superiours to impose certain Terms of Communion, it is not enough to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a <hi>Schismatick,</hi> to say that he is an <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poser,</hi> or to reckon up his several <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,</hi> without proving the sinfulness of them; but, I doubt not, but Mr. <hi>B.</hi> will rather chuse to state Cases, than under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take such a Task.</p>
                  <p>And therefore to proceed, Fifthly, He taxes several <hi>Imperfections</hi> and <hi>Abuses,</hi> which are accidental to the best consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Government, and some of which, we would be as glad to see mended as he: only the difference between us is, that we do not think it the best way of remedying <hi>abuses,</hi> to pull down the <hi>Church,</hi> when we know not how to set up a better in the room of it. Under this Head, may be reduced <hi>N.</hi> 40. where he complains of the <hi>too great extent of Parishes, where many thousand Parishio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners cannot be received in their Parish Church;</hi> But the Parliament must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form this, not the <hi>Diocesan Canoneers,</hi> who can neither make Parishes less nor bigger than they are. But why this should be thought a good reason to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Non-conformists to draw them from the Church, I cannot tell. It is highly
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:204354:103"/> necessary and desireable, that all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons may have convenient opportunities of publick <hi>Worship,</hi> and publick <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> in the <hi>Communion</hi> of the Church: but, upon this pretence, to suffer <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters</hi> to poyson our People with Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Principles, and to reproach and vilifie our <hi>publick Worship,</hi> and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the <hi>established Religion,</hi> is neither <hi>reasonable</hi> nor <hi>prudent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And indeed, this is a <hi>meer pretence</hi> to justifie their Separation; for there was great occasion for these Clamors in the late Times, when we heard nothing of them, and yet the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> did not think this a sufficient reason to suffer <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents, Quakers, Anabaptists,</hi> to keep Conventicles in their Parishes, for fear People should, <hi>like Savages, forbear all publick Learning and Worship of God:</hi> They usually keep their Conventicles in such places, where there is least need of their help, where there are Churches enough to <hi>receive,</hi> and Ministers, of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Abilities, to <hi>instruct</hi> their People: and, if there do want more Assistance in some Parishes, thanks be to God, we need not go to <hi>Dissenters</hi> for it. This, certainly, can be no reason of their Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformity, for they might do more
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:204354:103"/> Service this way by Conforming; and, if it be the true reason of their preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, let them but tell People so, that they do not desire to draw them from Communion with the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but only to supply the want of Churches, where the Parishes are too large, and I shall, for my part, entertain more favourable thoughts of them, than I have at present. But I abhorr Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie, and it is downright Hypocrisie for such men as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> to pretend that a reason for their preaching in <hi>Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Conventicles,</hi> which is not the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why they do it, (as appears from their doing it, where this reason cannot be pretended) but only a Popular Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse for doing it.</p>
                  <p>Thus, <hi>N.</hi> 41. he sayes, <hi>They swear the Church-wardens to present all that come not to Church, and punish them for not coming, when some Parishes have 40000, some 30000, some 10000, that can have no room, and the Church-wardens cannot know them.</hi> Now, supposing all this to be true, it is great pity it should be so; but how does this prove the <hi>Diocesan Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer</hi> to be a Schismatick? and, as for the Church-wardens, they are not sworn to do that which is impossible, but to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:204354:104"/> discharge their Office according to the best of their skill and knowledge; and yet, if they have a mind to it, those who are so well acquainted with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, as all men are supposed to be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they come to be Church-wardens, especially in such large Parishes, they may have some competent knowledge, who neglect the Church out of Irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Prophaneness, and who, out of Schismatical Principles: and indeed, though the Parishes be never so large, there are none, who have a mind to come to Church, but may find some op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, in a years time, to get room in it, and hold <hi>occasional Communion,</hi> as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> calls it, with other Parochial Churches, when they can't.</p>
                  <p>But, <hi>N.</hi> 42. he tells us, <hi>That if they go to other Parishes oft for Communion, they must not be admitted, but forbidden, and sent Home.</hi> Here we have another Tast of Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s sincere Dealing; he had been complaining of the vast numbers of Inhabitants in many Parishes, who could not have room in the Church, which made it necessary for <hi>them to hear and joyn with Non-conformists,</hi> unless, <hi>like Savages, they forbear all publick Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Worship of God.</hi> And, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:204354:104"/> that obvious Objection, that they may better go to other Parish Churches than to Conventicles, he adds here, that <hi>if they go to other Parishes oft for Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, they must be forbidden, and sent home:</hi> by which it is plain, he design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Readers should understand, that they might not, according to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of our Church, go to other Parish Churches, to hear Prayers or Sermon, when there is no Room in their own: for otherwise, his <hi>yet if they go,</hi> which joyns this Saying with what went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, makes it Non-sense, or Sophistry, if he does not speak of the same thing. But, for fear any man should discover the Cheat, he alters his Word, and calls it <hi>Communion,</hi> which has a large Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and may signifie either Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in Prayers and Preaching, or in Sacraments; for so the 28 <hi>Canon,</hi> to which, I suppose, he refers, respects on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> which every man is required to receive at his own Church, among his Neighbours; that their own Ministers may have satisfaction that they do receive it, but they are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to turn such Strangers out of the Church, when they come to hear Prayers, or Sermons. The Canons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:204354:105"/> only ordinary Cases; and, when we remember, that it is but of late years, that the Buildings in Out-Parishes have so vastly increased, we may reasonably suppose, that 40 years ago, when these Canons were made, though some Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes were too large, yet, the dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of numbers, above what the Parish Churches can receive, was not near (I may say, not near half) so great: and there never was any Church or Nation, that thought their Laws and Canons so Sacred, as to make no allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for Cases of Necessity. And yet we may observe, that there is not the same reason for giving People leave to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Sacrament at others Churches, as there is to frequent Prayers and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons elsewhere, when there is no room for them in their own Church: for 40000 may, with more ease, receive the Sacrament, by the frequency of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions in such large Parishes, than 10000 can joyn in Prayer and Sermons in one place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>N. 44. Though many melancholy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons dare not communicate in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and many others are secretly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious of Atheism, Infidelity, or Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, they must be compelled to receive
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:204354:105"/> thrice a year.</hi> What purpose this serves, I know not, but it contains a very fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish and spightful insinuation. The case is this; The Canons require, that every professed Christian, should, at least, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the <hi>Lord's Supper three times a year,</hi> and be liable to <hi>Church-censures,</hi> if they neglect so great and necessary a <hi>Duty.</hi> Is this a fault, for the Church to oblige her Children to observe every part of <hi>God's Worship?</hi> or is three times a year too often? It may be Mr. <hi>B.</hi> may think so, who acknowledges, that he did not administer the Sacrament once in 18 years. But, it may be, there are some <hi>melancholy Persons, who dare not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate in the Sacraments,</hi> and they <hi>must be compelled to it.</hi> But how does that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear? They must be returned to the Bishop, who is the ordinary Judge of these Cases, who will not <hi>censure,</hi> where there is a favourable Excuse, but <hi>exhort,</hi> and <hi>persuade,</hi> and <hi>convince,</hi> and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to cure that <hi>Superstitious Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly,</hi> which, when there is no other <hi>apparent cause,</hi> is either the effect of <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily distempers,</hi> or of <hi>Fanaticism,</hi> which has made some slight the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> and others, dread it. But, <hi>others are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly conscious of Atheism, Infidelity, or
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:204354:106"/> Wickedness,</hi> and they also <hi>must be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to receive:</hi> If this be <hi>secret,</hi> the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister cannot take notice of it, but must require them to do their Duty, as they are <hi>profess'd Christians,</hi> or to give a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why they don't; and then, if they think fit to confess, that they are <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ists, Infidels,</hi> or <hi>very wicked Persons,</hi> I will undertake, they shall not be <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled</hi> to receive, nor <hi>censured</hi> for not receiving, but for being <hi>Atheists, &amp;c.</hi> for, the Ministers are expresly command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to keep such Persons, when they are known, from the <hi>Communion,</hi> though Mr. <hi>B.</hi> does fairly insinuate, that our Church forces the most wicked and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate Wretches to <hi>communicate</hi> in the <hi>Lord's Supper.</hi>

But I will not take Mr. <hi>B's</hi> word for this, who, I believe, personally knows very
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:204354:106"/> few of them, and is none of the most favourable Judges to <hi>Conformists.</hi> That there are some, who are no Learned <hi>Rabbies,</hi> is no wonder, considering, how many small Vicaridges there are, which will not buy Bread for their Families, much less, furnish them with Books: though I am apt to think, there never was a more Learned Clergy in <hi>England</hi> than there is at this day; and some, whom he accounts <hi>raw and unskilful men,</hi> are able to discover his Sophistry, and despise all his Religious wheedles.</p>

We have another cast of his Office. <hi>If a Parish have a Priest so drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, that his own Family can scarce live with him, or so insufficient, that he never preaches, because he cannot, or will not, and People scruple encouraging such a one in his ill undertaking of the Ministry, and dare not take him for their Pastoral Guide, they are forbid to go from him, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate in the next Parish, and the Minister that receiveth them, or baptizeth their Children, though conformable, is suspended.</hi> For this he cites <hi>Canon</hi> 57. and, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, I am amazed to see such a man as Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> print such palpable falshoods, as will not admit of a <hi>civil parenthesis.</hi> As for <hi>drunken Priests,</hi> there is not one

                  <p>How unlike is this to that account Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> has given, when the whole scope and reason of this <hi>Canon</hi> is, to cure People of that <hi>superstitious conceit,</hi> that <hi>the efficacy of the Sacrament depends
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:204354:107"/> upon the Administrator,</hi> which is a rank piece of <hi>Popery,</hi> and too much countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by <hi>Fanaticism;</hi> the People imagining, that the Holiness and great Abilities of their Preachers, does, at least, add some Vertue to the Sacraments, and their Preachers favouring this <hi>Superstition,</hi> to gain Proselytes, and to keep them fast; which is the reason why we find their Books so stuffed with Complements to themselves, of Holy, Learned, Pious, Faithful Pastors, when they cannot af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford to speak truth of other men, nay, not to forbear unjust Calumnies and Reproaches. Indeed Mr. <hi>B.</hi> has some reason to be angry with this Canon, (and, I think, he has sufficiently reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged himself upon it) which seems to be levelled against those <hi>passive Conformist Preachers,</hi> who set up this Trade above forty years ago.</p>

He complains of the manner of advancing men to Rectories and Bishopricks, that Bishops are now made without the consent of the People, which is contrary to the ancient Canons of the Church, which say, that <hi>he is no Bishop that had not the Peoples Election and Consent.</hi> I would willingly see these Antient Canons, for, I confess, I never
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:204354:108"/> met with them yet; the People never had an Original Right in the choice of their Bishops, for they are not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Judges of their Ministerial Abilities: but they might bear testimony of their manners, as being the witness of their Conversation, and so they may still if they please; and when they do so, let them complain if any <hi>bad man</hi> be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained. Thus it was in the dayes of the Apostles, which is the only Primitive Antiquity Mr. <hi>B.</hi> will own, when he thinks it serves his turn: in after Ages, by degrees, the People pretended to something more in the Election of their Bishops, the inconveniency of which was found so great, that it was restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Antient <hi>Councils;</hi> and <hi>Canons</hi> were made for the Regulation of such Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And in some Churches this was never allowed, as particularly, at <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi> where the Bishop was chose by the twelve Presbyters, as Dr. <hi>Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet</hi> has largely proved; but the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <note place="margin">The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness of Separat. <hi>p. 313. &amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> between these two great men (as Mr. <hi>B's</hi> late Encomiast insinuates) is, that one is a profound Notion-maker without Book, and the other proves what he sayes, out of his Books.</p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:204354:108"/>
                  <p>But then he sayes, <hi>they suppose that God hath intrusted the King to chuse for all his Subjects, whom they shall commit the conduct of their Souls to, as their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors and Bishops.</hi> And indeed, all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Kings have thought themselves a little concerned, whom they allow to be the Publick Ministers of Religion in their Dominions, and so it must be, if we will allow them any Power in <hi>Religious matters;</hi> for nothing tends more to the advantage or injury of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> than good or bad Bishops and Pastors; and if the People may have their Vote in the choice of their Bishop, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> pleads, certainly the King may have his; not onely for himself, but for his People, who are committed to his care. And that this has been challenged by Christian Princes, and confirmed by the consent of the People, and never denied, or usurp'd on, but by the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal</hi> power, for several Ages, and of late, by the <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> is evident from that Learned Account the <hi>Dean</hi> has given us <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 325.</note> of this matter. But (the King) <hi>is not intrusted to chuse our Physicians, our Wives, our Diet, &amp;c.</hi> Truly, he would have a very troublesom work of it, if he were; and yet no man is an allowed Pysician,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:204354:109"/> but by some Authority derived from the King, as from the Power of the Universities, in conferring Degrees, or of the Colledge of Physicians, in grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Licenses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are originally owing to <hi>Royal Charters:</hi> and thus the King does chuse our Physicians for us. But is there no difference between the King's Power in matters of Publick Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the great Affairs of Church and State, and his intermedling with all the little Intrigues and Amours of private Families? It is an admirable Reason this; Princes must not chuse our Wives for us, therefore they are not concerned to take care of our Souls, nor of the Publick Administrations of Religion; they must not govern our private Families, therefore they must not govern the Kingdom; and yet, let me tell Mr. <hi>B.</hi> in his ear, that if he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a Wife, or wear any cloaths, or eat any Diet forbidden by the King's Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical or Civil Laws, he is account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for it; that is, our most private, and personal Concernments, as far as they fall under publick cognisance, or under the Government of the King; and therefore, their Choice, even in these matters, is not so absolutely free,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:204354:109"/> but that it is confined within certain Laws.</p>
                  <p>But, <hi>if a Papist, Heretick, or a hater of Pastoral Holiness, should ever be King, in how sad a case are the Peoples Souls?</hi> Now, I might answer this, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> does in a like case about Toleration, that <hi>the Magistrate is Judge whom he will</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Search for Schismat. <hi>p.</hi> 33.</note>
                     <hi>tolerate, but he must judge aright.</hi> Thus the King must judge what Bishops and Ministers the people shall have, but he must judge <hi>aright;</hi> but, if <hi>he be a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist, &amp;c.</hi> he is as likely to judge <hi>wrong</hi> about Toleration, as about the Choice of Bishops; but Mr. <hi>B.</hi> makes no Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction against this, unless when he says, <hi>they must judge aright,</hi> he means, that they must not be Judges when they don't judge aright, and then they never are Supreme Judges, if others may judge over their Judgment.</p>
                  <p>But this is Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s way, common to all, who design to disturb and Libell the Government of Church or State, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute against wholsom Constitutions from extraordinary Events, which may, or may not happen: we must not submit to two or three <hi>innocent Ceremonies,</hi> for fear the Church should appoint five hundred; and a Christian, Protestant,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:204354:110"/> Religious Prince, must have nothing to do in the choice of Bishops, because, if we should have a Popish, Heretical Prince, <hi>the Peoples Souls were in a sad case.</hi> While all sorts of Governments are exercised by men, who are fallible Creatures, and do not alwayes under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand their Rule, and, much less, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with it, no Form of Government can be secure from all inconveniences, and a Popular Government, least of any: and therefore, whatever may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, the choice of a King is liable to as few Inconveniences, as the choice of the People, who may as soon turn Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists and Hereticks as Princes; and are as subject to Schism as they are to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p>But this Objection, and many like it, proceeds upon this mistake, that there must be the same Rule for all Cases, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and extraordinary; as if People were equally obliged to submit to a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Bishop, promoted by a Popish Prince, as to submit to a Protestant Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, promoted by a Protestant Prince. Every Sovereign Prince, whatever his Religion be, will, as far as he can, esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish his own Religion; and, though such Princes abuse that Power which God
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:204354:110"/> has entrusted them with, when they set up and encourage a false Religion, and persecute the Professors of the true Religion, as they do, when they make unjust and tyrannical Laws; yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, this is no Argument, that a Prince, who imbraces the true Religion, ought not to use his Power for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting of it; and there cannot be a more effectual way to do this, than by taking care, that the great Ministers of Religion are such as deserve that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and will be faithful in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of so great a Trust: and to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, that Wise and Religious Princes are not to intermeddle in Religion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause bad Princes are not fit for it, is, <hi>as if mens wilful and wicked indispositions would change the Office, and disoblige both them and those that are guilty of no such unfitness, from the obligations laid upon them by the Lord: they may as wisely say, that a sober Physician is obliged to no more than a drunken one can perform, or, that a seeing man may do no more than the blind can do; or, that a Learned Prince may not meddle with Learning, because an Ʋnlearned Prince is not fit for it.</hi> Thus Mr. <hi>B.</hi> formerly reasoned, and very truly, in his Epistle Dedicatory
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:204354:111"/> before his <hi>five Disputations of Church-Government and Worship.</hi> And, as for the Souls of men, they are indeed by this means exposed to great Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, when they cannot enjoy the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of their Religion without Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution: but this is nothing but what our Saviour hath taught us to expect, and what God many times permits for the good of his Church. Christianity is the Religion of the Cross, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the most difficult Cases you can put, with respect to external suffering, can be no Argument against the obligation of any Christian Duty; and yet this is the onely difficulty you can name, for men, who love their Souls better than their Bodies, Lives, or Estates, may save their Souls, whatever be the Religion of their Prince.</p>
                  <p>N. 73. But he charges these <hi>Diocesan Canoneers,</hi> that <hi>they hold, that Patrons, be they never so ignorant or ungodly, must chuse all that shall have the Parochial trust of Souls.</hi> And does this make them Schismaticks, that they will not deny men their legal Estates and Inheritance, as the Right of Patronage is? But he sayes, <hi>(as to the possession of Temples and Tythes we yield it.)</hi> Well, what is the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:204354:111"/> Quarrel then, for that is all they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to dispose of? Why, he is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, that such men must have the cure of Souls, and that the People must chuse no other, but what such a drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Patron chuses for them; that is, he is angry that he cannot separate the Temple and Tithes from the Cure of Souls, and turn all the Livings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> into <hi>Sine-cures,</hi> that the Parish Priest may take care that no body runs away with the Church, while they run away with the Flock; and then, if ever a Rump Parliament gets up again, this will be an admirable Argument to prove Temples, and Tythes, and Ministers, useless; and, in the mean time, it would be an excellent occasion to declame against unfaithful and unpreaching Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters and dumb Dogs, when their People are so divided and scatter'd, that it is impossible to preach to them without the help of the speaking Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet.</p>
                  <p>But, suppose there be so many drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Patrons, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> intimates, they can present none but ordained Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and, if they be not qualified for such a charge, it is the Bishop's fault who ordains them, not the Patron's,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:204354:112"/> who presents them, and if the Bishop of the Diocese be duely informed, that the Person presented be either so vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or ignorant, that he is not qualified for such a Cure, he may refuse to grant him institution, or may suspend or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive him afterwards; and therefore the Patron's Right of Presentation can do no hurt, if other Persons concerned in it do their Duty; and certainly, the Presentation of the Patron, and the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the Bishop, is as likely a way to prevent any great miscarriages, as the Choice of a giddy, ignorant Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who seldom like what they do them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves long together.</p>
                  <p>There are some other pretty notes of a Schismatick scattered here and there, which cannot well be reduced under any certain Head; as <hi>n. 70. They sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from us and our Congregations, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to be joyned with;</hi> that is, those are <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> who think it unlawful to joyn in Schismatical Assemblies: and <hi>n.</hi> 75. it is a note of a Schismatick, <hi>to charge the Nonconformists with suspicions of Rebellion:</hi> and <hi>n.</hi> 77. to represent them <hi>as intolerable, seditious Schismaticks.</hi> Good men! who were never Rebells, but sometimes <hi>followed Providence,</hi> and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:204354:112"/> were never Schismaticks, but onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the <hi>Church</hi> into <hi>Conventicles,</hi> and separate Meetings. But the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santest charge is, <hi>n.</hi> 78. that <hi>by these means,</hi> that is, by thus scandalizing the Loyal and Uniting Non-conformists, <hi>Families are distracted, Husbands against Wives, Parents against Children.</hi> This, I confess, is a very deplorable Case, and whoever is the cause of it is certainly a Schismatick: but, I perceive I have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been in a mistake; for I thought that those who reproached an Excellent Church, and drew People from our Communion, occasion'd these unhappy Divisions in <hi>Families,</hi>

Mr. <hi>B.</hi> very well sayes, that <hi>Sensuality corrupts youth,</hi> and this ought to be restrained, and whoever will do so, must keep their Children and Servants under their Eye,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:204354:113"/> especially on the Lord's Day; for I will be bold to say, what constant Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience proves, that more Youth have been debauched this last Age, by the pretence of running to <hi>Conventicles,</hi> than by any one means besides. But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> does very finely insinuate, that Parents and Masters should not restrain their Children and Servants from going to <hi>Conventicles,</hi> but onely to take care of their manners, and let them chuse their Religion themselves; Excellent Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and certainly the most effectual way to make Atheists and Fanaticks in the World. <hi>Sensuality</hi> is a very bad thing, but such Liberty of Conscience as this, is the ready way to bring in <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suality</hi> and all other Evils.</p>

Such a Confederacy as this, may maintain some Peace and Order in Civil Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and make our Lives more easie and pleasant, than when we are enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in perpetual Quarrels, but it serves no purposes of Religion; it neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves the Scandal, nor the danger of Schism, which both undermines Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, and destroys mens Souls.</p>
               <p>And therefore to let all the World see, how little those men are for Union who talk so much of it, and raise such a mighty noise and clamour to call it back, I shall, as briefly as I can, shew wherein the nature of Christian Union consists, what that Union is, which is essential to the Christian Church, and I shall reduce all to these three Heads.</p>
               <p>First, That the Union of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church, is a Catholick Union, or the Union of the Church Catholick.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that this Union consists in one Communion.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, to prevent Objections, I shall consider the Difference between that Communion, which is essential to
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:204354:115"/> a <hi>Diocesan</hi> Church, to a national Church, and to the Church universal.</p>
               <p>First, That the Union of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church is a Catholick Union; that is, such an Union as makes the whole Church of Christ <hi>one body;</hi> for, the Apostle tells us, that <hi>there is but one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> as well as <hi>one Spirit, and one Lord, and one Faith, and one Baptism,</hi> &amp;c. 4 <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4, 5, 6. Now if Christ have but one Church, which is his Body, and his Spouse, that alone is the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Unity, which unites all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches in the World into <hi>one Body,</hi> or which unites any particular Church to the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not sufficient to Christian Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the Christians of one Nation or one Congregation, are united among themselves, unless they be united to the <hi>Catholick Church;</hi> for, if there be but one Church, a whole Nation may be Schismatical, as well as single persons, and there can be nothing objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this, without denying the very Notion of a <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that Christ has not one, but twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or a hundred several Bodies, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the number of various Sects and Parties of Christians.</p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:204354:116"/>
               <p>Now, methinks there should be no need to prove that Christ has but one Church dispersed over all the World; for though indeed we read of several Churches, as the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> of <hi>Corinth,</hi> of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> of <hi>Galatia,</hi> and the seven Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> yet these are called Churches, only as they are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeneal parts of the same Body. All these particular Churches having all the Essentials of a Church, as to Faith, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, Discipline; every one is called a Church, as every drop of Water is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Water, as well as a River, or the Sea; <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>The Universal Church indeed, in the first Beginnings of Christianity, was not so large as many particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations are now; before the day of <hi>Pentecost, The number of the names toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, were about an hundred and twenty,</hi> 1 <hi>Acts</hi> 15. And to them were three thousand added on the day of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> who were converted by St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s preaching, 2 <hi>Acts</hi> 41. <hi>Thus the Lord added
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:204354:116"/> to the Church daily, such as should be saved,</hi> v. 47. And the Gospel was by degrees propagated into other Countries, by the unwearied Labours of the Apostles, and especially of St. <hi>Paul;</hi> but yet it continued one Church still, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle assures the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> after he had planted so many Churhes in different and remote Countries, that there is but <hi>one Body,</hi> 4 <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. and compares the Unity of the Christian Church to the Unity of a Natural Body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. And that we may known, that he does not speak this of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> in particular, but of the Universal Church, he adds, <hi>v.</hi> 28. <hi>And God hath set some in the Church, first, Apostles, secondarily, Prophets, thirdly, Teachers; after that, Miracles, then Gifts of Healing, Helps, Governments, Diversities of Tongues.</hi> Now it is plain, that these several sorts of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisteries and Gifts, did not peculiarly belong to the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> nor to any Particular, but to the Universal Church: For Instance, the Apostolical Order was for the Propagation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity all the World over; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Church, which is one, as the natural Body is one, is the Catholick Church.</p>

               <p>This was the Sence of the ancient Christians, (of which, more hereafter) as we learn from <note n="*" place="margin">Ecclesia una est, quae in multitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ùs incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunditatis extendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur; quo modo So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis multi radii, sed lumen u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, &amp; rami arbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris multi, sed robur unum te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naci radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, &amp; cum de fonte uno rivi pluri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi difflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt, nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merositas licet diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atur ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undantis copiae largitate, unitas tamen servatur in origine: avelle radium Solis à corpore, divisionem Lucis unitas non capit; ab arbore frange ramum, praecisus arescet; sic &amp; Ecclesia Domini luce perfusa per orbem totum radios suos porrigit, unum tamen lumen est, quod ubique diffunditur, nec unitas corporis separatur, ramos suos in universam terram copin ubertatis extendit, profluentes largiter ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vos latius expandit, unum tamen caput est, &amp; origo una, &amp; una mater foecunditatis successibus copiosa. <hi>Cypr. de Unitate.</hi>
                  </note> St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> whose words are to this Effect. <q>The Church is one, though she fruitfully encrease into a multitude, and spread her self far and near; as the Rayes of the Sun are many, but the Light is one, and a Tree which hath many Branches, hath but one Stock, upheld by a firm and tenacious Root; and when ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Rivers flow from one Fountain, though they divide themselves into different Streams, through the great plenty and abundance of Water, yet they are all but one, as flowing from the same Head and Fountain. Try if you can pluck the Rayes from the Sun, they will shine no longer than they are united to that Body of Light; cut a Branch from the Tree, and see whether it will blossom, or bring forth Fruit after such a separation;
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:204354:117"/> part a River from that plentiful Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain which supplies it, and it imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately grows dry; thus the Church, which shines with a Divine Light, and diffuses its Rayes through all the World is but one Light, which will admit of no decision, but continues still united in one Body; like a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Tree, it sends forth its Branches on all sides, and, like an overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fountain, divides into different Streams, and waters all the dry and barren corners of the Earth, but yet there is but one Head, one original Fountain, one Mother blessed with a numerous off-spring.</q> From whence it appears, that it was St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s judgment (as indeed it was the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Opinion of that Age of the Church, and of several Ages after, and never que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned till this last Age of New Lights) that it was as impossible for a particular Church to retain the nature and privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and saving vertue and Graces of a Church in a state of Separation from the Catholick Church, as it is for the Beams of the Sun to give Light, when they are cut off from the Body of the Sun, or for a River to be reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with Waters, when it has no
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:204354:118"/> communication with the Fountain, or for a Branch to flourish, when it is broke off from the Tree.</p>
               <p>And, I observe farther from St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi>'s words, that the Catholick Church, though it consist of all particular Churches, which are contained in it, yet is not a mere arbitrary Combinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Confederacy of particular Churches, but is the root and fountain of Unity, and, in order of Nature, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent to particular Churches, as the Sun is before its Beams, and the Root before its Branches, and the Fountain before the Rivers which flow from it: that particular Churches are made by the increase and propagation of the Catholick Church, not the Catholick Church by the combination of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches; and therefore nothing is more familiar in the Writings of the ancient Fathers, than to hear of <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siae Catholicae,</hi> and <hi>Episcopi Catholici;</hi> for those particular Churches and Bishops were called <hi>Catholick Churches</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Bishops,</hi> who lived in Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the <hi>Catholick Church;</hi> so that particular Churches received their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination from the Catholick Church, and none were accounted true Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es;
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:204354:118"/> but as they were considered as Parts and Branches, and Members of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, which were plain Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense, if the Catholick Church were nothing else but an aggregate body, made up of an arbitrary Combination of particular Churches; for then, they must be considered as true Churches, standing by themselves, antecedent to any respect to their Union with the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church.</p>
               <p>This is a matter of great Consequence, which utterly tears up the very Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of <hi>Independency,</hi> and therefore deserves to be more fully explained, and indeed there is some need of it; for, it sounds very odly, to say that the Catholick Church is, in order of Nature, before particular Churches; whereas, if we will allow that Christianity had a Beginning, and was gradually propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated in the World, according to that account we have of it's Rise and Growth in the <hi>Acts of the Apostles,</hi> we must acknowledge, that the number of Christians was so small at first, that they could make but a very little Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Church was first planted in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> before the Gospel was preached in other parts of the World,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:204354:119"/> which was first occasion'd by the Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution that was raised against the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians at <hi>Jerusalem, Acts</hi> 8. which drove them into other Countries, where they preached the Gospel, and convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men to the Faith of Christ; so that the first Beginning of a Christian Church was a single Congregation, and the particular Church of <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> But then the Church became Catholick and Universal, when the Gospel was preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Christian Societies were formed after the first original pattern, in all parts of the World.</p>
               <p>Now this is very true also, that the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> (or the Christian Church, and the State of the Gospel) <hi>is like to a Grain of Mustard seed, which a</hi>
                  <note place="margin">13 Math. 31, 32.</note>
                  <hi>man took, and sowed in his Field, which indeed is the least of all Seeds; but when it is grown, it is the greatest among Herbs, and becometh a Tree, so that the Birds of the Air come and lodge in the Branches thereof:</hi> that is, that the Beginnings of the Christian Church are very small, but it vastly increases in a short time, and spreads it self over all the World; and therefore, if by the Catholick Church, we mean no more, than that Church which is in all parts of the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:204354:119"/> World, it is evident, that that Church of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was before the Catholick Church, that is, that the Church was planted in <hi>Jerusalem</hi> before there was a Christian Church in any other Parts, much more, before there was a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church in all parts of the World.</p>
               <p>And therefore, for answer to this, we must observe, that according to the ancient Fathers, there are two things included in the notion of the Catholick Church; first, that the Church is but one; secondly, that it is every where; for therefore it is called Catholick, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause all the Churches in the Christian World, are but <hi>one Church.</hi> Thus St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> in his Epistle to <hi>Maximus,</hi> &amp;c. calls it <hi>Catholicae Ecclesiae Ʋnitatem,</hi> the <note place="margin">Epist. 51.

               <p>So that though in the beginnings of Christianity, the true Church of Christ was confined to one small Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet it was the Catholick Church, because it was that one Church of Christ, which was to increase and spread it self over all the World, not by infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite divisions into new Independent Churches, but by multiplying it self into numerous Churches, living in the same Catholick Communion and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: and therefore we read in <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 47. when great numbers were daily converted to Christianity, not that they increased into new Churches, but
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:204354:120"/> that they were added to the Church; <hi>The Lord added to the Church daily such as should be saved.</hi> This is what St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> sayes, that, though the Church be never so much increased, yet there is but <hi>unum caput, una origo, una ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter foecunditatis successibus copiosa,</hi> as I observed before; all these Churches proceed from one root and cause, are the Children of the same Mother, which make still but one Family and <note place="margin">Itaque tot ac tantae Ecclesiae, una est il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la ab Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolis pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, ex quâ omnes Sic omnes pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae &amp; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicae, dum una omnes prob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Thus <hi>Tertullian</hi> having given an account when the Gospel was propagated, and Churches planted, by the Apostles, beginning at <hi>Judaea,</hi> and so preaching in all parts of the World, adds, that hence it is, that so many and so great Churches are but that one Church, first planted by the Apostles, from whence all others come: thus all are first and Apostolical, while all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether prove that Unity which makes them all one.</p>
               <p>Indeed, nothing can be more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to this notion of Catholick Unity, than the Parables of our Saviour, and the familiar expressions of Scripture, whereby the Unity of the Church is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed. Thus the Church in this World is compared to a <hi>Field,</hi> wherein the

                  <hi>sowed Tares;</hi> whereby our Saviour means, the mixture of good and bad men in the visible Church, but it is but one Church, one Field still, while they live in the same Communion. Thus, to <note place="margin">v. 47, 48, 49.</note> the same purpose, <hi>the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is compared to a net which was cast into the Sea, and gathered of every kind, both good and bad fish;</hi> which must be meant of the Visible Church on Earth, because bad men are not admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven; but the <hi>Angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from the just,</hi> and yet the Church in this World is but one <hi>net;</hi> thus it is compared to <hi>a grain of mustard-seed,</hi> which grows into one <note place="margin">v. 31. 32.</note> tree; <hi>to leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened,</hi> but it was but one lump <note place="margin">v. 33.</note> or Mass still; <hi>to a woman cloathed with</hi>

               <p>But there is one thing more observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, of great Moment in this case, that Christ calls himself a <hi>Shepheard,</hi> and his Church a <hi>Sheepfold,</hi> and declares, that there shall be but one Fold, as there is but one Shepheard; <hi>And other Sheep I</hi>
                  <note place="margin">10 John 16.</note>
                  <hi>have, which are not of this Fold, and they shall hear my Voice, and there shall be one Fold and one Shepheard.</hi> Now, if we consider who these two sorts of Sheep are, of whom our Saviour speaks, and how they are united into <hi>one Fold,</hi> it will be an evident demonstration of the Unity of the Catholick Church. Those first sort of Sheep our Saviour mentions, signifie the <hi>Lost Sheep of the House of</hi> Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, who were his peculiar Care, while he was on Earth, as he tells the Woman of <hi>Canaan, 15 Math. 24.

His other Sheep were the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who were also to be called to the Supper, to be invited <note place="margin">14 Luke 15. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:204354:122"/> to the Faith of Christ, and Communion of the Church, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi> told the <hi>Jews,</hi> when they <hi>contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and blasphemed, It was necessary, that the Word of God should first have been spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to you; but seeing you put it from you, and judge your selves unworthy of everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Life, loe, we turn to the Gentiles; for, so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I</hi>

                  <hi>have set thee to be a Light to the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for Salvation to the ends of the Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, the way whereby these two sorts of Sheep become <hi>one Fold,</hi> is by receiving the Gentiles into the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Christian Church; for Christ did not destroy the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church, no more than he did the Law and the Prophets, but only refine and perfect it into a Christian Church.</p>

               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:204354:124"/>
               <p>Now nothing can be a plainer De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration of the Unity of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, than the Gentiles being received into, and incorporated with the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church; for, all men who understand any thing of these matters, must, and do acknowledge, that the Jewish Church, <hi>the Commonwealth of</hi> Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, was but one Church, and one Commonwealth; and if the Gentile Converts do not make a new Church, but only enlarge the bounds of the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelitish</hi> Church, it is plain, that the Catholick Church continues as much one, as the Jewish Church was before the appearing of Christ, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of the Gentile World. This the believing <hi>Jews</hi> themselves understood at the Beginnings of Christianity, that the Gentiles were received into their Church, by believing the Gospel, which made them so vehemently urge the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of Circumcision, as judging it impossible, that any man should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated into the body of <hi>Israel,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Circumcision, which was the sign of God's Covenant with them, and which separated them from the rest of the World. And this made so many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving <hi>Jews</hi> so zealous for the Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:204354:124"/> of the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> because they looked upon Christianity only as an Addition to <hi>Judaism,</hi> not as a total change and alteration of it.</p>
               <p>I doubt not, but the Unity of the Jewish Church, considered as a Type of the Christian Church, is a very good Argument to prove the Christian Church to be but one, as I am abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly satisfied from those very mean and slender Objections, made against it by learned men; for though, as some argue, the Christian Church is designed to excell the Jewish Church, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth not correspond with it in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing, yet, I hope there is not a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Excellency than Union, unless it be a more perfect and excellent Union, and that we will grant to the Christian Church; but yet I think this perfection of Union in the Church, does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in dividing or multiplying the Church into a great many loose, incoherent, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent Churches, which are nited like a Rope of Sand.</p>
               <p>Much less does it hence follow, <hi>That all Christians should annually meet in one place,</hi> any more than that they should keep the Feast of the Passover, of <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecost,</hi> or Tabernacles. There are some
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:204354:125"/> things peculiar to them as one Nation, others as a Typical Church, others as ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical of Catholick Unity: and he who knows not how to distinguish these things, shall perplex and entangle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but neither satisfie his Reader, nor convince his Adversary.</p>
               <p>Much less does it hence follow, <hi>That Christians should have one Arch-Priest on Earth,</hi> when the Jewish High Priest was a Type of that great High Priest, who was not so much to exercise his Priest-hood on Earth, as in Heaven, if we will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Author of the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews, 7 Heb.</hi> and several other places.</p>
               <p>And 'tis as groundless a conceit, from hence to conclude, <hi>That we should be all subject to one temporal Jurisdiction, and speak one Language,</hi> which was peculiar to them, as one Commonwealth and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, not as one Church: The Jews continued one Church under the <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonish</hi> Captivity, where they neither met in one place annually, nor, it may be, spoke one Language; and yet, if we consider that the Commonwealth of <hi>Israel</hi> was a Theocracy under the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Government of God, and that <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>Joshua,</hi> and the Judges, and Kings of <hi>Israel,</hi> were immediately set up
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:204354:125"/> by God, as they who were to govern his People in his name, and by his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and by his Order and Council, so they were Types of the Regal Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Christ, who governs the Church in God's name, and according to his Will, as <hi>Aaron</hi> was a Type of his priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Office. Now this is an odd way of arguing from a typical Dispensation, to prove that the Antitype must be the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry same with the Type; it is sufficient, if the Antitype have something that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers the Type, though it be more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and excellent in it's kind; as to be of one mind, and to speak the same things, is more excellent than to speak the same Language; and an universal and glorious Head in Heaven, who is both King and Priest, is more perfect and excellent, than a King and Priest on Earth.</p>
               <p>There is a great Difference, I will grant, as it is objected, between a Church of one Nation, and of all the World, and they cannot upon all accounts be united in the same manner; but if the universal Church be united so, as to continue one body, it is sufficient; of which, more hereafter.</p>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:204354:126"/>
               <p>And, whereas it is objected, <hi>That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law, Christian Religion, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, a Christian Church, did, in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance subsist, but what Ʋnity of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was there then?</hi> It is impossible to give a direct answer to this, because we know not what precise time is meant; if the time before the Flood, we have a very imperfect account of those Ages, and yet have little Reason to doubt, but the antidiluvian Patriarchs, who preserved themselves from the general Corruptions of the Age, were careful to maintain a publick face of Religion, which necessarily supposes some kind of Union and Government. When all Flesh had corrupted it self, except <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> the Church was confined to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and preserved from the Deluge of Waters, in the Ark, which the ancient Fathers make a Type or Emblem of the Unity of the Church, out of which there is no Salvation. After the Flood, no doubt <hi>Noah</hi> himself was the high Priest, as well as universal Monarch of the new World; and some think, that <hi>Melchize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deck,</hi> to whom <hi>Abraham</hi> paid Tithes, was no other than <hi>Sem,</hi> one of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Sons. And when the Church was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined again to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:204354:126"/> there is no difficulty to discover the Unity of it, even before the Law.</p>
               <p>But this seems to me a new way of reasoning, <hi>Christianity was in Substance before the Law,</hi> that is contained in some obscure Prophecies, and some good rules of Morality; but <hi>there was no Ʋnity of Government,</hi> before there was a visible Christian Church, therefore the Unity of the <hi>Jewish Church</hi> is no type of the Unity of the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> when it shall be catholick and visible: or there were some seeds of Christianity sown in the World, before the Law, but did not yet appear above ground; therefore there was a visible Christian Church, because there was an invisible Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; for no other Church is capable of external and visible Unity and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: or there was no Unity of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, before there was a visible Christian Church, therefore there must be none, now there is.</p>
               <p>And what is farther objected, that <hi>the temporal Ʋnion of the</hi> Jews <hi>might only figure the spiritual Ʋnity of Christians, in Faith, Charity, and Peace,</hi> I grant it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, if by Charity and Peace, is meant a Catholick Communion, which is the only true Charity and Peace of the Christian
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:204354:127"/> Church; but if only mutual Kindness, and forbearing Quarrels and Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, though men divide into distinct and independent Communions, it seems strange to me, how the Unity of Policy and Government in the Jewish Church, should figure no Unity of a Church, but an Unity of another kind, which does not belong to a Church, as a Church: for, men who are of no Church, nor under any civil or ecclesiastical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may love one another, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear Quarrels, but to be Members of the same civil or religious Society, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly signifies some other kind of Union than this. When we enquire after the Unity of the Church we mean an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and visible Unity, which must signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie something more than that spiritual and invisible Union of Charity and Peace; for, there may be no great Peace, when men do not publickly fight with one another.</p>
               <p>So that unless there be some more material Objections, than I could ever yet see, the Unity of the Jewish Church considered in it's typical Nature, is a very good Argument to prove the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Union in the Christian Church; but, when we consider farther, that
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:204354:127"/> the Jewish Church, as perfected by the express Revelations of the Gospel, is still the Root of Union, whereon the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Christians are grafted, and so grow up into one Church; if the Jewish Church ever was one, it is so still; for the Jewish Church was not dissolved by Christianity, but enlarged by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Gentile Converts.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Law was but Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity vailed by Types and Figures, and when the Vail was taken away, Christianity appeared in it's true Glory and Lustre: but it was the same Church vailed and unvailed; into the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of which Church, the Gentiles were received, the partition Wall of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical Ceremonies and Ordinances being taken away, and abolished by the death of Christ; and thus both Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles became one Sheep-fold under one Shepheard, which St. <hi>Austin</hi> upon the place tells us, signifies the Unity of the Church Catholick, and condemns the Schism of the Donatists. It were easie to add much more to prove Catholick Unity, that the whole universal Church is but one Body and Society of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; but this is enough at present, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:204354:128"/> that I shall add greater Light and Strength to it in what follows.</p>

               <head type="sub">That the Ʋnity of the Catholick Church consists in one Communion.</head>
               <p>THE second thing to be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is, that the Unity of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church consists in one Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Catholick Unity signifies Catholick Communion, and one Communion sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies one Christian Society, of which all Christians are Members; for so the Church is called, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Fellowship, <hi>John</hi> 1. 3. To di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish it from a Sect or Party: and to have a Right to Christian Communion, signifies of Right, to be a Member of this Society, a Member of the Body of Christ, or the Christian Church, to communicate in all the several duties and offices of Religion, with all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians all the World over, and to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in all the Priviledges of Christians,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:204354:128"/> and to be admitted to the freedom of their Conversation, to eat, and drink, and discourse, and trade together. For in the first Ages of Christianity, Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication did not only shut men out of the Church, exclude them from their religious Assemblies, from the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Word, and Prayers, and Sacraments, but drove them from the civil Conversation of Christians; all Christians did avoid and fly from them, as rotten and putrid Members, which must be cut off from the Body, and perfectly separated from the conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christians; no man would talk with them, or receive Visits from them, or entertain them at their Table, or <note place="margin">

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:204354:129"/> called a Brother, be a Fornicator, or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, or an Idolater, or a Railer, or a Drunkard, or an Extortioner, with such a one no not to eat;</hi> which plainly refers to common Conversation, for it forbids us to keep company with lewd and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly Christians in the same sense, as it allows us to keep company with other Sinners who are not Christians; and when he adds, <hi>with such a one not to eat,</hi> he represents this eating with these men, as a matter, in the Opinion of most men, of no great consequence, for so that phrase signifies, you shall not so much <hi>as do such a thing;</hi> whereas, the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental eating the body of Christ is one of the highest Acts of Christian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
               <p>And therefore, a Right to Christian Communion, signified a Right to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Society of Christians, and to joyn with them in all the parts and offices, whether of a religious or civil Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is briefly comprehended by <hi>Tertullian,</hi> in three things, <hi>Communicatio pacis, appellatio fraternitatis &amp; contessera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio hospitalitatis, de praescript. cap.</hi> 20. in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting them to the Peace of the Church, (of which more anon) in calling them
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:204354:129"/> Brethren, and in the mutual Offices of Hospitality; so that the Christian Church was such a Society, Body, and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of men, as were strictly associated for all the Ends and Purposes of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and humane Life; and this was call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Christian Communion, which is now most commonly restrained to acts of Worship, or to the Communion of the Lord's Supper.</p>
               <p>And therefore there were several De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Christian Communion, which signified the several Rights and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, which some men enjoyed in the Christian Society; such as the <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio Ecclesiastica,</hi> which signified the Communion of the Clergy, or that Right, and Priviledge, and Authority, which they had, which differed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their several Orders, of Bishops, Presbyters, and Deacons; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when any of them had been guilty of such Sins as made them unworthy of so holy a Function, they were degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and thrust down into the state of Lay-men, but not into the State of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents, as Lay-men were, when they <note place="margin">Preface to the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>
                  </note> sinned; and in this Sense it is certainly true, what a late Author has observed,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:204354:130"/>
                  <hi>Quis unquam clericum lapsum paenitentem vidit?</hi> that, according to the ancient Discipline of the Church, (to which, no doubt St. <hi>Chrysost.</hi> had respect, in that Passage which is cited from him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either book or page) no man ever saw a Clergy-man in the state of Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents; not as he or his Author expound these words, that no Clergy-man who was fallen into Sin, ever proved a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent; that is, did ever repent of his Sins, which are two very different things.</p>
               <p>Thus that Right which Lay-men had of Communion in the Christian Church or Society, was called <hi>Communio laica,</hi> or Lay-Communion, which consisted in the Communion of Prayers and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which they were deprived of, when they lived unworthy of this Communion, either wholly or in part, by Excommunication, or other milder Censures: but this is sufficient to let you understand, what the Ancients meant by Christian Communion, which in a large Notion, signifies the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church or Society, which is called Communion from the Communication which all the Members of it had with
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:204354:130"/> each other. And hence we easily learn, what it is to live in the Communion of the Church; <hi>viz.</hi> to communicate with all the Members of the Church, in all the Duties, for the sake of which, that Society was instituted, such especially as hearing the Word read or preached, Prayers and Praises, and Sacraments, and Discipline; for it is contrary to the very notion of Christian Communion, not to communicate, and excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, being nothing else but the shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting men out of such Societies, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying them the Liberty and Priviledge of communicating with Christians, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion must signifie actual communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
               <p>Now, that Christian Unity does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in Christian Communion, and is a Catholick Communion, as well as Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Unity, appears to me so plain and evident, both from the Precepts and Historical Accounts of the Apostolick Churches in Scripture, and from the best and most ancient records of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, that I confess, I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it has admitted of any dispute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst learned men.</p>
               <p>That the Church of Christ is one, that
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:204354:131"/> Christ hath but <hi>one Body, which is his Church,</hi> is so expressly affirmed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that all men must acknowledge it in one sense or other; for it is plain, that this was the design of our Saviour, in the Institution of a Church, that all his Disciples should be one. For, this our Saviour prays, 17 <hi>John</hi> 11. 20, 21. <hi>Holy Father, keep, through thy name, those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one as we are. Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also, which shall believe on me, through their Word, that they all may be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us; that the World may believe, that thou sent me, and the Glory wbich thou gavest me, I have given to them, that they may be one even as we are one, I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one, and that the World may know, that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then all such Expressions are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly expounded of an Unity of Faith, or Unity of Love, and Charity, and Peace, not of one Communion, that is not of the Unity of a Church or Body, or Christian Society: the Unity of
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:204354:131"/> Faith, and Love, and Charity, and Peace, are indeed essential parts of Christian Unity, but do not signifie the whole of it. The Unity of Christians consists in the Unity of a Body and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of men, which necessarily suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses the same Faith, and a mutual Love and Charity, as the Bonds and Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of such an Union, but their Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on consists in their being incorporated into one Society. The Members of a Body cannot be united without Nerves and Sinews, and other Ligaments which tye them together, and make a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of Life and Spirits, from one part and member to another; but let a Body have never so many Nerves and Sinews, if they do not unite the parts to each other, and cause a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of Life to the whole, it is not one body; thus, how orthodox so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever private Christians are in their Faith, whatever their Love and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be, if the same Faith and a mutual Love do not unite them into one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, they have not the Unity of a Body, nor of a Church.</p>
               <p>So that the case is plainly this, when our Saviour and his Apostles speak of
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:204354:132"/> the Unity of Faith, and Love, and Charity, they include the Unity of Communion too, which ought natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to follow from them; or else, when they speak of the Unity of the Church, and of a Body, they mean something more by it, than the meer Unity of Faith and Charity, because it is possible, that men who believe the same things, and love one another, should not be Members of the same Body and Church.</p>
               <p>But, to consider these things a little more particularly; The Unity of Faith must be acknowledged, as absolutely necessary to the Unity of Christians, for Hereticks are no Members of the Christian Church; and therefore we are commanded by the Apostle, <hi>To with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 3, 4, 5.</note>

               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:204354:132"/>
               <p>And yet this very often happens, as the Experience of the present and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages too plainly proves, and when the same Faith cannot unite men into <note place="margin">Thus St. <hi>Augustin</hi> expressly asserts, <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Christus caput est &amp; corpus: ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put unige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitus Dei filius, &amp; corpus ejus Ecclesia, sponsus &amp; sponsa, duo in carne una.

Et rursus quicun{que} de ipso capite Scripturis Sanctis consentiunt, &amp; unitati Ecclesiae non commanicant, non sunt in Ecclesiâ, quia de Christi corpore, quod est Ecclesia, ab ipsius Christi testificatione dissentiunt. i. e.</hi> Whole Christ is Head and Body. The Head is the only begotten Son of God, and the Body is his Church; Husband and Spouse, two in one Flesh. Whoever dissent from the Holy Scriptures, about the Head (that is, who have not a true Faith, do not believe a Right of Christ) though they are found in all those places where the Church was foretold to be, yet they are not in the Church. And on the other hand, those who believe of the Head, what the Scriptures teach, (who have a true Faith) but do not communicate in the Unity of the Church, are not in the Church, because they differ from the Body of Christ, which as Christ himself tells us, is his Church. St. <hi>Aug. de unitate Eccles.</hi>
                  </note> one Body, it cannot make them Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the same Church. St. <hi>Paul</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed tells his <hi>Ephesians,</hi> That they <hi>are built upon the Foundation of the Apostles, and Prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief Corner-stone;</hi> but he adds, <hi>In whom the whole building, fitly framed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, groweth into an holy Temple in the Lord.</hi> Their being <hi>built upon the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Apostles and Prophets</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, that the Unity of Faith is the Foundation of this spiritual Building, but then there is somewhat more requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a Building, than merely a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:204354:133"/>
                  <hi>they grow up into a holy Temple;</hi> and therefore those, who do not grow up into one Temple, but into distinct and Separate Churches, whatever Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they may have as to the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, do not grow up into one Building, or one Church.</p>
               <p>Indeed St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Ephesians</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, that men may have one Faith, and yet not live in the Unity of the Church, when he perswades them to <hi>keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Nay, this Notion of Catholick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, was universally owned in the Ancient Church by all sorts of men,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:204354:134"/> even the greatest and most notorious Schismaticks; The Schism of the <hi>Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> and <hi>Donatists</hi> did necessarily sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose this as the foundation of their Schism: for they asserted, That who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever did communicate with the lapsed, or the Traditors, did defile themselves by such a sinful Communion, and were no better than lapsed and Traditors themselves; and therefore, since the Catholick Church did communicate with <hi>Cornelius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> whom the <hi>Novatians</hi> accused of communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the lapsed, and with <hi>Caecilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> whom the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natists</hi> accused of being ordained by a Traditor, they renounced the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the whole Catholick Church, which had been as foolish, as it was wicked, had they denied the necessity of Catholick Communion; for Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Churches cannot be polluted with each others miscarriages.</p>
               <p>And this was the only Argument wherewith the Ancient Fathers oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed those growing Schisms, that there is but one Christian Church, and one Christian Communion all the World over, and therefore, whoever did not live in the Communion of that one
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:204354:134"/> Church, and communicate with it in all Christian Offices and Duties, was out of the Church, was guilty of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Separation from the Body of Christ, how Orthodox soever their Faith was; for they had no other way to oppose these Schisms, but by asserting the evil of such Separate Communions: for neither the <hi>Novatians</hi> nor the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists,</hi> were ever accused of any other Heresies in Matters of Faith, but what concerned their Schism; they owned the Ancient Creed, and retained the Order of Bishops, (for which reason Mr. <hi>B.</hi> brands them with that infamous name of <hi>Prelatical Donatists;</hi> for I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, there could not well be any Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian or Independent <hi>Donatists,</hi> before there were any Presbyterians and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents in the World) and pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to greater severity in the Exercise of Discipline, than the Catholick Church did, which was the reason of their Schism; very agreeable to the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of our present <hi>Dissenters:</hi> and tho St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> condemns and rejects <hi>Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianus</hi> for this reason also, that he was ordained <note n="*" place="margin">Agno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scant at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligant, episcopo semel fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto, &amp; col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legarum ac Plebis te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonio &amp; judicio compro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bato, ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitui nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo modo posse <hi>Cypr.

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:204354:135"/> not then know of any Canon which forbad it.</p>
               <p>But the Schism of <hi>Novatianus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted in his opposing himself against his Bishop, and separating from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Catholick Church, and setting up a new Altar, and new Church of his own, <note n="*" place="margin">Profanum Altare eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere, &amp; adulteram ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedram collocare, &amp; sacrilega contra verum Sacerdotem sacrificia of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre tentaverit. <hi>Cypr.</hi> Ep. 67. ad <hi>Steph.</hi>

                  </note> therefore he is so far from owning him to be a Bishop, that he denies him to be a Christian, because he is not in the Church: but is an adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate and opposite Head, out of the Church. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in his Book <hi>de Ʋnitate Ecclesiae,</hi> which was purposely writ in confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Novatian Schism,</hi> his whole Design is to prove, that there is but one Church, and that it is absolutely necessary to preserve the Unity of this Church by one Communion.</p>
               <p>For, if the Independency of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es had been known in those dayes, what fault could the <hi>Novatians</hi> or <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natists</hi>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:204354:136"/> have been charged with, for set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up distinct and separate Churches, only, as they pretended, for the sake of a more pure Communion? for they are charged with Schism only upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a causless Separation, which had been a very wild charge, had all Churches, by the Institution of Christ, been Independent, distinct and sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Communions.</p>
               <p>Nor do I see how it is possible to prove the necessity of Communion with any one particular Church, without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging the necessity of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Catholick and Universal Church; for when the Unity of the Church is once broke and divided, I can see no end of it, but that men may divide into as many separate Churches and Communions as they please. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can make Separation a Sin, but an obligation to preserve the Unity of the Church; but if the Church Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal be not one, there can be no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to preserve its Unity; there may then be ten thousand separate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions as well as two, and every man may communicate with what Church he pleases, and when he pleases; if he can perswade any to joyn with him,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:204354:136"/> he may set up a new Church, and new Communion of his own, and no hurt done neither, if they continue in the Unity of the Faith.</p>
               <p>And yet St. <hi>Austin,</hi> in disputing against the <hi>Donatists,</hi> takes the same Method, which St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> had done before him in disputing with the <hi>Novatians,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from his Book of the <hi>Ʋnity of the Church,</hi> in answer to the Letter of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilian</hi> the <hi>Donatist,</hi> and several other Treatises; as his Answer to <hi>Parmenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and the Letters of <hi>Petilian,</hi> and <hi>Cresconius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In his Book of the <hi>Ʋnity of the Church,</hi> he tells us, that the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie depends upon the answering this Question, <note n="*" place="margin">Ubi est Ecclesia, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum apud nos, an apud illos? quae utique una est, quam Majores no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stri catholicam nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt, ut ex ipso nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne ostenderent, quia per torum est. <hi>Sanct.

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the onely Argument St. <hi>Austin</hi> uses to obtain this Cause, is to prove, that the Church of Christ is but one, dispersed through all the World: and
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:204354:137"/> therefore those, who communicate with the Universal Church, have the true Church; those who communicate only with the Sect and Party of <hi>Donatus,</hi> which is shut up within the narrow bounds of <hi>Africa,</hi> are out of the Church: and to make good this, produces vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of Testimonies from the Old and New Testament, to prove, that the true Church of Christ is Catholick and Universal, and therefore the Sect of <hi>Donatus,</hi> which did not communicate with the Church of Christ, is no true Church: Now, whether this Argument be true or false, it shews what sense St. <hi>Austin</hi> had of the Catholick Church, and the necessity of Catholick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; for otherwise, the <hi>Donatists,</hi> who professed the Catholick Faith, might be Members of the Catholick Church, as well as their Adversaries, if Catholick Communion, as well as a Catholick Faith, were not necessary to that end,</p>
               <p>I readily grant, the Ancient Fathers speak much of the Unity of the Faith, as essential to Christian Unity, not as if this alone were sufficient to make a Church one and Catholick; for it is plain, it was not thought sufficient in
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:204354:137"/> the case of the <hi>Novations</hi> and <hi>Donatists,</hi>

               <p>But, though Faith alone is not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to Christian Unity, yet Faith, in combination with those other Graces of Love, and Charity, and Peace, makes a firm and lasting Union. This I rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily grant, but yet must add this one thing, that Christian Love, and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Peace, in the Language of the New Testament, and of the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, when they signifie Christian Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, signifie also one Communion; that is, the Unity of a Body and Society, which is external and visible, and does not only signifie the Union of Souls and Affections, but the Union of an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and visible Communion.</p>
               <p>As for Love and Charity, I need not tell you how frequently this duty is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated upon all Christians: our only Inquiry is, what this signifies; and to determine that, let us briefly consider some few places, where we find it mentioned, and very earnestly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to us.</p>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:204354:138"/>
               <p>Our Saviour makes this a Badge and <note place="margin">13 John, 34. 35.</note> Character of our Discipleship; <hi>A new Commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another, as I have loved you, that ye love one another; by this shall all men know, that ye are my Disciples, if ye have love one to another. We must love one another as Christ loved us.</hi> How is that? Under what Notion did Christ love us? This Question St. <hi>Paul</hi> answers, <hi>Husbands</hi>

                  <hi>man ever yet hated his own Flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the Church, for we are Members of his Body, of his Flesh, and of his Bones.</hi> Christ's Love then to us, is included in his Love to the Church, which is his Body, and his Love to us in particular, considers us, as Members of his Body, for he is only <hi>the Saviour of the Body,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">v. 23.</note> and therefore if we must love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as Christ hath loved us, we must love one another as Members of the same Body, that is, must live in Christian Communion and Fellowship with each other.</p>
               <p>Thus Christian Love and Charity must be such a Love, as is visible to all men, and may distinguish Christians
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:204354:138"/> from all other Sects and Professions of men. <hi>By this shall all men know, that you are my Disciples, if you have Love one to another.</hi> Now nothing can do this, but that Christianity which unites all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians into one Communion; for, those who refuse to worship God together, can never be known to be the Disciples of the same Master, unless you can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the World to believe, that Christ instituted as many several ways of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, as there are Schisms and Divisions in the Church.</p>
               <p>And whatever other mutual Kindness and Respects they may pay to each other, this is no peculiar Sign of their being Christ's Disciples; for the Laws of our Religion require us to be kind and friendly, and to do all good Offices for all men, to love even our Enemies, and those who hate us. And there are some who are not Christians, who do so excell in all external Civilities, Affability, and Curtesie, that if this were the peculiar Badge of Christianity, they might pass for Christians, without believing in Christ; and we see Heathens and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans, and the vilest Sinners, love one another, and therefore it cannot be the bare loving one another, which makes
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:204354:139"/> men Christians, but loving one another in the Communion of the Christian Church. And that this is true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Charity, St. <hi>Paul</hi> teaches us; <hi>That there should be no Schism in the Body, but</hi>

                  <hi>that the Members should have the same Care one for another, and whether one Member suffer, all the Members suffer with it, or one Member be honoured, all the Members rejoyce with it; now ye are the Body of Christ, and Members in particular.</hi> This is to love one another, to love like Members of the same Body, to preserve the Body from all Rents and Schisms, and to maintain Christian Sympathy and Charity in the Communion of Christ's Body, whereof we are all Members.</p>
               <p>Thus in another place, the same Apostle represents Christian Love, as the necessary cause and effect of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Unity. <hi>Speaking the Truth in Love, may grow up into him in all things which</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 4 15. 16.</note>
                  <hi>is the Head, even Christ, from whom the whole Body fitly joyned together, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted by that, which every Joynt supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the Body, to the edifying of it self in Love;</hi> so that Christian Charity unites us to Christ's Body, and by Charity the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:204354:139"/> Christian Church is more firmly knit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and is edified in all Christian Graces and Virtues, and grows up into a holy Temple in the Lord; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is Christian Love and Charity, which does not unite us in one Body.</p>
               <p>And this was plainly the Sense of the ancient Church also, concerning Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Charity, that it united men into one Body and Communion, and that there was no true Christian Charity out of the Church.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Clemens Romanus</hi> a true Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical Bishop, in that Epistle which he wrote to the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> in the name of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose those Schisms and Divisions which had broke out afresh among them, uses only this one Argument to asswage their Passions, and to reduce them to a more peaceable and governable Temper; he very highly commends Charity, and condemns Wrath and Strife, and Envy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and Emulations, and bitter Zeal, as very hateful to God and Christ, and very unworthy of a Christian man: and among other things he tells them, that <note n="*" place="margin">

                     </gap>. Clem. Rom. Ep. ad Corinth.</note>
                  <hi>Love and Charity will cause no Schism, it is not tumultuous and factious, but does
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:204354:140"/> all things in Agreement and Concord.</hi> And if true Christian Charity be inconsistent with Schism, there can be no true Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity out of the Communion of the Church.</p>
               <p>Much to the same Purpose, St. <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> discourses, in his book of the <hi>Ʋnity of the Church;</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Quam verò unitatem ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat, quam dilectionem cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stodit, aut cogitat, qui dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordiae furore vesanus, Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiam scindit, fidem de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struit, pacem turbat, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatem dissipat, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum profanat. <hi>Cypr. de unitate.</hi>

               <p>And thus all those passages of the Fathers are to be understood, which speak of Christians <hi>being united in Love, and knit together in the bond of Ʋnion and Charity, as the Members of the Body of Christ;</hi> that is, that Charity unites them into one Christian Communion; not that it is sufficient to be united in Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, without being united in one Body and Christian Society. Men may love one another very well, and yet not be Subjects of the same Prince, nor Members of the same City or Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, much less belong to the same Houshold and Family; but we are not Christians, unless we are Members of the Body of Christ; and therefore, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is Christian Charity, which does not invite us into one Body, as Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Charity always does; as St. <hi>Austin</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Qui com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporati sunt aedifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio supra petram constituto. <hi>Aug. de Unitate.</hi> cap. 18.</note> tells us, that <hi>by the bond of Charity we are incorporated into that Building which is founded on a rock,</hi> that is, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church: for, that Treatise of <hi>Ʋnity</hi> being written designedly against the Schism of the <hi>Donatists,</hi> in answer to the Letter of <hi>Petilian,</hi> he can mean

               <p>Christian Charity is the same thing with what, in other places of Scripture, <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 10. 1 Thes. 4. 9. Heb. 13. 1. 1 Pet. 3. 8.</note> is called <hi>Brotherly love,</hi> and <hi>loving like Brethren;</hi> now this name <hi>Brethren</hi> was given to none, even in the Apostles dayes, but to those only who lived in the Communion of the Church; and this was religiously observed in the Primitive Church, where the Christian Brotherhood was confined to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church, and neither He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, nor Schismaticks, nor excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated Persons, nor those who were under Penance, nor the Catechu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens, which were not yet baptized, were called Brethren, by the <hi>Fideles,</hi> or those Christians who were in full Communion, as <hi>Albaspin</hi> has observed; <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Albasp.</hi> l. 1. <hi>obs.</hi> 19. de fraterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianorum.</note> and therefore those Evangelical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Brotherly Love supposes Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians to be Members of the same Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and cannot reach further than Christian Communion does.</p>
               <p>Let us, in the next place consider, what is meant by <hi>Peace,</hi> which Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:204354:141"/> are so frequently exhorted to, and which St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>the bond of peace;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 3.</note> now this also signifies the external and visible Communion of the Christian Church. Thus Christ is called <hi>our</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 14, 15, 16.</note>
                  <hi>Peace,</hi> because he has united Jews and Gentiles into one Body or one Church. Thus the Apostle tells us, that <hi>God is</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 33.</note>
                  <hi>not the Author of confusion but of Peace, as in all the Churches of the Saints:</hi> where <hi>peace</hi> being opposed to <hi>confusion,</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) must necessarily signifie the peaceable Communion of the Church, where all things are done de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently and in order; and thus <hi>peace</hi> seems to signifie in that Apostolical Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation, which is usually prefix'd to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epistles, <hi>Grace be with you, and Peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ;</hi> for, whatever some men may talk, it is absolutely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to maintain Christian Peace, when Christians divide from each other into separate Churches and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for their very Separation signifies an aversion to each other; and while some are zealous to preserve the Unity of the Church, as all good Christians must be, and others are zealous to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their Separation, as Schismaticks
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:204354:142"/> alwayes are, what hope is there of Peace and Concord in the midst of Disputes and fierce oppositions? there never was a Schism yet, but what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed the Peace, as well as broke the Unity of the Church; and, I shall not easily believe it can be, till I see some instance wherein it is so, and that I fear I shall never see in this Age; and therefore, in the mean time, if we will own it our Duty to preserve the Peace of the Church, we must acknowledge it our Duty to live in the Communion of the Church.</p>
               <p>To be sure this was very agreeable to the Language of the Ancient Church; for, in the Writings of the Ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Councils, nothing is more familiar than by the <hi>Peace of the Church,</hi> to understand <hi>the Communion of the Church.</hi> Thus, when men were under Excommunications and Censures, they were said to <hi>desire Peace,</hi> to <hi>receive Peace,</hi> and the Bishop <hi>to give them the Peace of the Church,</hi> when they were restored to Christian Communion; and to <hi>dye in peace,</hi> signified to dye in the Communion of the Church: and the <hi>osculum pacis,</hi> the <hi>kiss of Peace,</hi> which <note place="margin">Rom. 16. 16. 1 Cor. 16. 20.</note> St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls the <hi>holy kiss,</hi> and St. <hi>Peter
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:204354:142"/> a kiss of Charity,</hi> is by St. <hi>Chrysost.</hi> as he <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 14. <hi>Albasp.</hi> l. 1. obser. 17.</note> is cited by <hi>Albaspinus,</hi> made a Symbol and Representation, not only of the union of Affections, of Love, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but of the Unity of an external and visible Communion.</p>
               <p>But, for the farther confirmation of this, <hi>That Catholick Ʋnity does consist in Catholick Communion,</hi> let us briefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the Nature and Use of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Sacraments, which are the great and firmest bonds of Christian Union: and they are these two: <hi>Baptism</hi> and the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Supper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for <hi>Baptism,</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that there is but one <hi>Baptism,</hi> as there is but <hi>one Body,</hi> and <hi>one Spirit,</hi> and that <hi>by this</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 4, 5. 1 Cor. 12. 13.</note>
                  <hi>one Spirit,</hi> which is bestowed at Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, <hi>we are all baptized into one Body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free.</hi> Baptism makes us Members of the Catholick and Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Church; for we are not baptized into any particular Church, as, suppose the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or the Church of <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>Holland,</hi> but are made Catholick Christians, that is, Members of the Universal Church, and have a right to Christian Communion in all true Churches in the World, which
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:204354:143"/> cannot possibly be, unless we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that there is but one Church, one Body and Society of Christians all the World over, which are bound to live in Communion with each other.</p>
               <p>For Independent Churches are like some little Independent Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, which have no commerce or intercourse with each other, at least, by being Members of one Commonwealth, they are not incorporated into the Neighbour Commonwealths, nor can challenge any priviledge in them but upon courtesie.</p>
               <p>Now, I would desire to know, if In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent Churches, consisting of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Congregations, be the only Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of Christ's Institution, whether Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism be our Admission into the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church, or not? if it be not, I would desire to know what it signifies, and in what sense we are said to be <hi>baptized into one body?</hi> if it be, I would enquire farther what this admission into the Church by Baptism signifies? whether a right and obligation to external and visible Communion in all Religious Duties and Offices, that is, whether Baptism makes us such Church-members as are bound to joyn in the Worship of
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:204354:143"/> God, and our common Saviour? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if it does not, I would desire them to tell me, how men can be admitted, into the Christian Church, and yet not be made Church-members, when Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which shuts them out of the Church, is no more than debarring them the Priviledges of Christian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, which, it seems, according to these Principles, those who are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the Church by Baptism, have no right to, and therefore are not in a much better condition than the Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate? if it does, I would enquire farther, what Church-baptism makes us Members of? the Independents will not allow that it makes any man a Member of an Independent Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church, for that is done by a Church-Covenant; nor will they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that there are any other Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of Divine Institution, but onely Congregational Churches, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Baptism makes men Members of no Church. For, to say that Baptism makes men Members of no particular Church, and yet makes them Members of the Universal Church, if the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Church be nothing else but a great number of particular Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:204354:144"/> Churches, is as absurd, as it is to say, that a man may be born into the World, and not yet born into any part of the World.</p>
               <p>But the Apostles and the Ancient Fathers alwayes acknowledged but one Baptism, and that for this reason, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is but one Church, and therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> joyns one Baptism with one Body; for Baptism makes us Members of one Body, and one Church, which is dispersed all the World over, and in what particular Church soever any man is baptized, unless he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards forfeit his Right by Heresie or a wicked Life, he is a Christian all the World over, and has a Right to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Communion in all Churches.</p>
               <p>We may easily understand the sense of the Ancient Church in this matter, from that hot Dispute about Re-bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, or rather about the baptizing those who were baptized by Hereticks; for both Parties were agreed upon this point, that there was but one Church and one Baptism, which made them Members of that one Church, and that it was unlawful to re-baptize any one who had been once bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</p>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:204354:144"/>
               <p>St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and the <hi>African</hi> Bishops, rejected the Baptism of Hereticks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is <hi>but one Baptism in the</hi>

               </p>
               <p>On the other hand, <hi>Stephen,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and those Bishops who joyned with him, and some time after, St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> and <hi>Optatus,</hi> and those who writ against the <hi>Donatists,</hi> and condemned their practise of Re-baptizing those who were baptized in the Catholick Church, would not condemn even the Baptism of Hereticks, (while it was administred in that solemn form of words, which our Saviour appointed, <hi>In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost)</hi> for this very Reason, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there was but one Baptism in the Christian Church, which implanted us into the one Body of Christ, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it's Virtue and Efficacy, not from the Worthiness of the Minister who
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:204354:145"/> baptized, but from a divine Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>I will not undertake to decide this Controversie, but only observe, that though they drew very different Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences, yet they argued from the same Premises, and all agreed, that there was but one Baptism, because there was but one Church. And if we will allow, as they all granted, that Baptism made us visible Members of the Church of Christ, and gave us Right to visible Communion, the Unity of Baptism proves, not only that there is but one Church, but that there is but one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in the Catholick Church.</p>
               <p>And it is observable, that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> assigns this as the Reason, why <hi>Novatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> rebaptized those who came over to <note place="margin">Nam <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatianus</hi> simiarum more, qui cum homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes non sint, homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes tamen imitantur, vult eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siae Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licae Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritatem sibi &amp; veritetem vindicare, cùm ipse in ecclesia non sit, imò adhuc insuper contra ecclesiam hostis rebellis extiteri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The Lord's Supper is another Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Christian Church, and does so plainly signifie one Church, and one Communion, that it is impossible to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the true nature of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without it.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives us an account of it, in <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 16, 17, 18.</note> these words, <hi>The Cup of Blessing which we bless, is it not the Communion of the Blood of Christ? The Bread which we break, is it not the Communion of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Christ? For we being many, are one Bread and one Body, for we are all Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of that one Bread; behold</hi> Israel <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Flesh, are not they which eat of the Sacrifices, Partakers of the Altar.</hi> In which words, there are several things to be observed to our present Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
               <p>As first, the Scope and Design of them, which was to deter Christians from going to Pagan Feasts, where they eat and drank of such things, as were
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:204354:146"/> offered in Sacrifice to Devils, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themselves to those persons, who keep those Feasts in honour of those wicked Spirits, to whom they sacrificed; which the Apostle tells them, was to <hi>have Fellowship with Devils, by drinking</hi>
                  <note place="margin">v. 20. 21.</note>
                  <hi>the Cup, and partaking of the Table of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils.</hi> Now the only proof we find of this, must be fetched from the Nature and Institution of the Lord's Supper, and the Jewish Sacrifices, in the words now cited, from whence the Apostle draws this Conclusion; and therefore, when the Apostle calls the Eucharistical Cup and Bread, <hi>The Communion of the Blood, and of the Body of Christ,</hi> it sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies, that we are in Fellowship with Christ, and with each other, with him as our Head, and with each other, as Members of the same Body; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, their eating and drinking at Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Feasts, could not prove, that they were in Fellowship with Devils and Idolaters.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I observe, that this Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristical Feast, in how many distant places soever it be celebrated, is but <hi>one Bread and one Cup;</hi> for so the Apostle express<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly asserts, that there is but <hi>one Bread,</hi> as there is but <hi>one Body,</hi> for the Bread re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:204354:146"/> the Body of Christ, and the Cup his Blood, and therefore is but one, as the Body of Christ is one.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that this one Bread signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the Union of all Christians in one Body, for so we are told, <hi>we being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, are one Bread, and one Body, for we are partakers of that one bread:</hi> that as this one bread signifies that one Body of Christ which was broken for the sins of the whole World, so it signifies, that all those who partake of this one bread, are united into one Body, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Christ is the Head.</p>
               <p>Thus St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> understood these words, when, speaking of this myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Sacrament, he says, <hi>that it signifies and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Quo ut ipso Sacramento po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulus noster adunatus osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditur; ut quemadmodum grana multa in unum colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta, &amp; commolita, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixta, panem unum faciunt; sic in Christo, qui est panis coelestis, unum sciamus esse corpus, cui conjunctus sit noster numerus &amp; adunatus. <hi>Cypr.

                  <hi>the Ʋnion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian People; for, as many grains put together, and ground small, and well mix'd, make one Bread, so we know that in Christ there is but one Body, to which our whole number is united and combined.</hi> Where we must observe, that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> does not say, that this one Bread does signifie, that their number or company, who liv'd, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:204354:147"/> in the same Church, and actually communicated with each other, is one Body; but that <hi>in Christ there is but one Body,</hi> to which their number or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety is united, as is signified by their partaking of that one Bread: so that the <hi>one Bread</hi> signifies that <hi>one Body of Christ,</hi> which is his Universal Church, to which all Churches are united, as partaking of that one Bread.</p>
               <p>And, by the way, we may hence ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, how the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by her new Doctrine of Transubstantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, destroys the true mystery and sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of this holy Feast; for, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Doctrine, every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian eats the whole intire Body of Christ, which is in every wafer, nay, in the least part of every wafer; which does not onely contradict the notion of a broken Body, which is represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Sacramental bread, but spoils the Apostle's Argument for the Unity of the Christian Church, that all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ns are <hi>one Bread and one Body;</hi> for, when ten thousand men, and as many more as you please, do each of them eat the whole Body of Christ, it seems difficult to understand how Christ has but one Body, or how this signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:204354:147"/> that all Christians are but one Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, This <hi>one bread</hi> signifies one Communion in the Christian Church: Thus the <hi>Cup</hi> is called <hi>the Communion of the Blood of Christ,</hi> and the <hi>Bread, the Communion of the Body of Christ,</hi>

                  </gap>, which signifies, that it is a common Table, and that whoever par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of it, are in Fellowship and Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety with Christ, and with one another; for so <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> signifies in St. <hi>John</hi>'s Epistle, <hi>Our Fellowship is with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>

                  <hi>and with his Son Jesus Christ.</hi> And the Lord's Supper is peculiarly called Communion or Fellowship, because it does most aptly signifie the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christians in one Body or Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, of which Christ is the Head, and in the Union of which, he dispences all the merits of his Death and Passion.</p>
               <p>Thus St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> discourses at large <note place="margin">

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> the Apostle say, the participation</hi> (of the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:204354:148"/> Body of Christ) <hi>because he intended to signifie something greater, and to represent a more close and intimate Ʋnion and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, for we communicate not only by partaking and receiving</hi> (the Bread) <hi>but by being united; as the Body is united to Christ, so are we united to him by the Bread.</hi> And upon those Words, <hi>for we being many are one Bread and one Body,</hi> he adds, that it is, as if the Apostle had corrected himself in this manner, <hi>Why do I speak of Communion when we our selves are that very Body? For what is the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:204354:148"/> Bread? the Body of Christ; who are they that receive it? the Body of Christ: not many Bodies, but one Body: for, as the bread, which is made of several grains, is so mixed and kneaded together, that you can no longer discern the particular grains, but one lump and mass, thus are we uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to each other, and to Christ; for thou art not nourished by one Body and he by another, but all by the same Body; and therefore the Apostle adds, For we all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of that one bread; and, if we all partake of the same, we are all the same, and why then should we not shew the same</hi>
                  <note place="margin">* <p>Obiter hoc dicit, ut intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thii,</hi> exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na quoque professio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne colen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam esse illam uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem, quae nobis est cum Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sto; quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doquidem omnes si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mul con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venimus ad sacrae illius uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolum.</p>

                  <hi>Love to each other, that we might be all one that way also?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> upon these words, <hi>there is one bread,</hi> tells us, <hi>that the Apostle hereby admonishes the</hi> Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>that it is their Duty to maintain this Ʋnity they have in Christ by an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal profession of it,</hi> that is, by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and visible Communion; for so he adds, <hi>That they must all meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to celebrate that Feast, which is a Symbol of this Sacred Ʋnity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that the Apostle here does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to signifie one Christian Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is evident from that Argument he
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:204354:149"/> urges, from the Example of <hi>Israel after the Flesh, are not they which eat of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices Partakers of the Altar:</hi> that is, all united and combined in the Worship of that God, at whose Altar those Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were offered; for though all <hi>Israel</hi> did not eat of the same Sacrifices, yet they all offered their Sacrifices at the same Altar, which signified, that they were all the Worshippers of the same God, who had but one Altar, and that they were all incorporated into one Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the Commonwealth of <hi>Israel,</hi> who alone had Right to offer at that Altar. And it is very agreeable to this, what St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> tells us of the whole Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church, that it has but <hi>one Altar;</hi> for when he had told his People to whom he writ, to beware of <hi>Felicissimus,</hi> who had made a Schism among them, <hi>That there is but one God, and one Christ, and one Church,</hi> he adds, and but <hi>one Altar and one Priest-hood,</hi> which must be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of the Universal Church, and so signifies one Catholick Communion, which, by the way, quite spoils Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Argument, which he so often repeats, That a Bishoprick in St. <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> time was no larger than one single
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:204354:149"/> Congregation, because St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> asserts, that <note place="margin">Deus unus est, &amp; Christus unus; &amp; una Ecclesia aliud altare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitui, aut Sacerdotium novum fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eri praeter unum altare, &amp; unum Sacerdotium, non potest. <hi>Cypr. ad Plebem de quinque Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teris Schismat.</hi> Ep. 40.</note> every Bishop had but <hi>one Altar,</hi> whenas he also asserts the same of the whole Christian Church, and thereby he means not one place of communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but one Communion. And for the same reason, St. <hi>Austin</hi> calls the Communion of the Donatists, <hi>Altare Schismatis,</hi> an Altar of Schism.</p>
               <p>The principle design indeed of the Apostle in this place, is to prove, that the using any religious Rites and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies (such as feasting upon a Sacrifice, <note place="margin">Aug. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Parm. Ep. l. 2.</note> always was accounted) did signifie our Communion and Fellowship with that God, whose Worship it is; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, those who feasted on Pagan Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, had Fellowship with Devils. But his Argument proves something more, that all the Worshipers of the same God, were in Fellowship with one another; that as eating the Sacramental Bread does unite us to Christ, so it makes us all one Bread, and one Body, that is, one external and visible Society and Communion: for, if the Lord's Supper signifies Unity, it must signifie one
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:204354:150"/> Communion, because the very nature of it requires that it be celebrated in Company, which is the great Argument urged by Protestants, against the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Masses of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to proceed, as the Unity of the Christian Sacraments proves the Unity of Christian Communion, so also does the Unity of Church Power and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Every Bishop, Presbyter, or Deacon, by his Ordination is made a Minister of the Catholick Church, though for the better Edification of the Church, the exercise of his Office is more peculiarly confined to some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular place. Every Bishop and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter receives into the Catholick Church by Baptism, as I have already proved, and shuts out of the Catholick Church by Excommunication, as I shall prove hereafter, which they could not do, were they not publick Officers of the Universal Church.</p>
               <p>And St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> tells us, that there is but <note n="*" place="margin">Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patus unus est, cujus à singulis in solidum pars tenetur. <hi>Cypr. de Unitate.</hi>

               <p>And in his book of <hi>the Ʋnity of the Church,</hi> the first Argument he urges to prove the Unity of the Church, is the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:204354:151"/> Unity of the Apostolical Office, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs this as the Reason, why our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, in a particular manner, committed the Keys to <hi>Peter,</hi> (when he gave the same Power to all the rest of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, <note place="margin">16 Math. 18. 19.</note> which he did to <hi>Peter) viz.</hi> to manifest the Unity of the Apostolical Office and Power, that <hi>there is</hi>

                  <hi>but one Chair and one original of Ʋni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which begins in one; for, the rest of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles were the same that</hi> Peter <hi>was, had an equal share in the Honour and Power of the Apostolical Office; but the beginning is from Ʋnity, and the Primacy is given to</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>that it might appear that the Church of Christ is one, and the Chair one,</hi> i. e. <hi>the Apostolical Office and Power. They are all Pastors, but there is but one Flock, which is fed by all the Apostles with a joynt Consent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the plain Scope and Design of this passage of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> (which has been so often abused, especially by the <hi>Romanists)</hi> that our Saviour in
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:204354:151"/> naming <hi>Peter</hi> onely, in giving the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical Power, did signifie, that the Apostolical Office, though exercised by several Persons, is but one Office and Power, which is not so properly divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded among the Apostles, as administred by a joynt consent, and therefore, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Power to one Apostle, inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the bestowing this Power on the whole Apostolical Colledge.</p>
               <p>And therefore, when St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> says, <note place="margin">Super il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum unum aedificat ecclesiam suam. <hi>id. ibid.</hi>
                  </note> that Christ built his Church upon <hi>Peter</hi> alone, he does not and cannot mean the Person of <hi>Peter,</hi> or any thing pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to him, but that Apostolical Office and Power, which was given to the College of the Apostles in the name of <hi>Peter,</hi> as the Church is said to <hi>be built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets.</hi> And when he sayes, that Christ gave the Primacy to <hi>Peter,</hi> and yet at the same time affirms, that the other Apostles were equal sharers with him in Honour and Power, and were all that which <hi>Peter</hi> was, it can signifie no more, nor no less, than that Christ named <hi>Peter</hi> first, or rather, instead of all the Apostles, thereby to instruct them; that though they were many, yet their Office and Power was but
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:204354:152"/> one, which they must exercise as one man, with one consent.</p>
               <p>And now I cannot but wonder to find some Learned men very zealous Asserters of the Independency of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and to alledge St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority for it: for, whatever difficulty there may be in giving an account of every particular Saying in St. <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> certainly, he could never be of this Opinion, who, asserts but one Chair, and one Apostolical Office and Power, which now resides in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of the Universal Church; for when the same power is in ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand hands, it can be <hi>one</hi> onely by Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of consent in the exercise of it; and it is very wild to imagine, that any one of these Persons, who abuse this Power, shall not be accountable to the rest for it.</p>
               <p>For we must consider, that all the Apostles had relation to the whole Church, and therefore, though being finite Creatures, they could not be every where at a time, but betook themselves to different places, and planted Churches in several Countries, and did more peculiarly apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the Government of those
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:204354:152"/> Churches, which they themselves had planted, and ordained Bishops to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed them in their Care and Charge, yet their original Right and Power in relation to the whole Church did still remain, which they might re-as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume, when they saw occasion for it, and which did oblige them to take care, as far as possibly they could, that the Church of Christ suffered no inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by the Heresie or evil Practises of any of their Collegues; and though Equals have no Superiority over one another, yet a Colledge has Authority and command over any of its Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legues.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Rigaltius</hi> has observed upon <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Stillingst.</hi> Rational account. p. 300.</note> St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> as the Learned Dr. <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet</hi> has before noted, that <hi>St. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian not doubting from the nature of the Ʋnity of</hi>

                  <hi>Ecclesiastical Discipline, but the care of all Churches was upon him, dispatched his Letters to the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>from whence they were sent through the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, as an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that there was but one Episcopal Office in the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:204354:153"/> whole Church, part of which was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in full power to every Bishop.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if we consider the practise of the Ancient Church, we shall find, that they never thought every Bishop to be Independent, but as liable to the censures of their Collegues, as Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Deacons were to the Censures of their Bishops.</p>
               <p>It were easie to reckon up numerous Canons of ancient Councils, which suppose this Authority in the Church of deposing heretical or scandalous Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and prescribe Rule for the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating of it.</p>
               <p>And there are too many Examples in Ecclesiastical History of this Nature. The Bishops, who ordained <hi>Novatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> were deposed, so was <hi>Paulus Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosatenus,</hi> by the Council at <hi>Antioch,</hi> and <hi>Domnus</hi> substituted in his room. <note place="margin">Cypr. <hi>Ep.</hi> 68.</note> Thus <hi>Basilides</hi> and <hi>Martialis</hi> were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, and <hi>Felix</hi> and <hi>Sabinus</hi> made Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops in their stead. The like may be said of <hi>Eustathius</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Sebastia,</hi> of <hi>Marcellus</hi> of <hi>Ancy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> and <hi>Photinus</hi> of <hi>Sirmium,</hi> and many others: and we never find that those Persons who were deposed did dispute the Power and Authority of the Church
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:204354:153"/> to depose Bishops, but justice of the Cause, and therefore many times made their Appeals from Provincial to General Councils, or from one Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil to another.</p>
               <p>And indeed, the Independency of Bishops is as inconsistent with <hi>Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Ʋnity,</hi> which St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and others so often mention, as the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency of single Congregations; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with this difference, that a Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick is larger, and contains a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particular Congregations under it, but yet the danger to the Church may be as great from an Heretical and Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Bishop, who may infect his whole Diocese, without any remedy.</p>
               <p>And this very reason St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> gives, why there are so many Bishops in the Christan Church, whom he calls <hi>a copious body of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Idcirco enim frater charissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, copiosum corpus est Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotum concordiae glutino, atque unitatis vinculo copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, ut siquis ex collegio no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stro heresin facere, &amp; gregem Christi lacerare &amp; vastare tentaverit, subveniant caeteri, &amp; quasi pastores utiles &amp; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sericordes oves Dominicas in gregem colligant. <hi>Cypr.</hi> ad <hi>Steph.</hi> Ep. 67.</note>

               <p>This seems sufficient to shew what St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Opinion was in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, let us therefore now briefly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, for what reason some have thought that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> did assert eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Bishop to be Independent, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to none but Christ, and the reason seems to be a very weighty one, that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> sayes so in express words, though, methinks, it should make men careful how they expounded such words to contradict his avowed Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Practise, and the practise of the Universal Church; for, if every Bishop be absolutely unaccountable to any but Christ, he cannot be lawfully deposed by all the visible Authority of the Church.</p>
               <p>And therefore to adjust this matter, we must particularly consider, what those cases are wherein every Bishop is at liberty to make Rules for himself, and govern his Church according to his own Prudence and Conscience, without being bound to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Actions to his Fellow Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.</p>
               <pb n="217" facs="tcp:204354:154"/>
               <p>That this does not extend to Heresie or Schism, is evident from those Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies which I have already produced, for then the Church would have no power to excommunicate and depose Heretical or Schismatical Bishops, and the like may be said of any great and enormous sin, such as Idolatry, and renouncing Christianity in the time of Persecution, which was the case of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silides</hi> and <hi>Martialis,</hi> two <hi>Spanish</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops; and St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> does exhort the People to forsake the Communion of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cypr.</hi> Ep. 68.</note> such Bishops, and commends those that did: Not as if he made the People the Judges of their Bishops, or that they were for every fault or miscarriage to leave their Communion, and set up other Bishops, but when they were guilty of such notorious Heresie, or wickedness, that, by the Judgment and Censure of Neighbour Bishops, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial or General Councils, they were deposed, the People also should with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from them; for the onely thing upon such an occasion, that can make any breach in the Church, is, when the People will not forsake the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of such Heretical or Schismatical Bishops, though they be very justly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:204354:155"/> and others ordained in their room. For this was the present case, <hi>Basilides</hi> and <hi>Martialis</hi> were actually deposed, and <hi>Felix</hi> and <hi>Sabinus</hi> actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ordained Bishops, when St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> writ to the People to avoid the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of those Sacrilegious Bishops: as, upon a like occasion, he writ to his own People of <hi>Carthage,</hi> to avoid <hi>Felicissimus</hi> and those factious Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <note place="margin">Ep. 40.</note> who were of his Party, when they were first excommunicated by <hi>Caldoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ep. 39.</note> and <hi>Herculanus;</hi> which I observe by the way, that no man may mistake such Expressions, as we sometimes meet with in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and other ancient Writers, perswading the People to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake wicked or unsound Bishops, to justifie People in making a factious op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to their Bishop, or upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>capricio,</hi> running into a tumultuary Schism.</p>
               <p>The Heresie must be very notorious, and the Crime very foul and scandalous, which will justifie either Presbyters or People, to withdraw from their Bishop, before a judicial Sentence, or at least, without the Advice of some neighbour Bishops. Thus <hi>Nestorius</hi> was deserted by several of his Presbyters, and by
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:204354:155"/> many of the People, before he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Council of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and St. <hi>Hierom</hi> writ a reproving Letter to <hi>John,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> but it was after <hi>Epiphanius</hi> writ to them to beware of his Heresie, as being suspected of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianism.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to come closer to the busines in hand, I acknowledge St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> does assert, that every Bishop has the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his own choice in governing the Church over which he is Bishop; and that if he differs from others in some matters, yet he is not to be judged or <note place="margin">Cypr. Conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thag. de hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticis bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizandis ad Anton. Ep. 52. ad Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel. Ep. 55. ad Steph. Ep. 72. ad Magnum Ep. 76.</note> deprived of Catholick Communion for it; for no one of them pretends to be a Bishop of Bishops, nor can they either judge or be judged by one another; but they must all expect the Judgment of Christ, who both gave them this Authority, and is the only proper Judge of their Actions. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose he discourses in several places, as you may see in the Margin, and yet was far enough from owning an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Independency of Bishops, as will appear, if we consider these things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That he allows of this only in some matters of Discipline, and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Administration of Church Affairs,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:204354:156"/> especially when the case was new and undetermined; for he has mentioned but two cases, wherein he has asserted this Liberty to every Bishop: 1. The reconciling those to the Church, and receiving them to Christian Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who had fallen in times of Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And 2. Baptizing those when they returned to the Catholick Church, who had formerly been baptized by Hereticks, and he limits and confines this Power to matters of Discipline; <hi>That in the Government and Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Quâ in re nec nos vim unquam facimus, nec legem damus cúm habeat in Ecclesiae administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis suae li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berum arbitrium unusquis{que} praepositus, rationem actus sui domino reddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turus. <hi>Cypr. ad Steph. Ep.</hi> 72.</note>
                  <hi>of Church Affairs, every Bishop enjoys the Freedom of his own Will, and is to give an Account of his actions to the Lord.</hi> And therefore he says, that <hi>in such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters they offer no Force, nor give Laws to any man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now in such matters as these, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when the Controversie is first start<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Judgments of very wise and good men, being different and various, and the Church having always allowed different Customs and Usages in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Churches, and having often alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Rules of Discipline, as the Good
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:204354:156"/> of the Church, and the Edification of Christians required; and every Bishop best understanding the Necessities of his own Church, and what is most agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the present state of Affairs, it was highly reasonable, that every Bishop should enjoy this Liberty, without which, he must needs be at a loss upon every new emergent Difficulty, which will not admit such Delays, till he can consult with all his Neighbours, much less with foreign and remote Bishops.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Even in these matters, especially if there be any apparent difficulty, he requires the advice of Fellow Bishops, that, as near as may be, they may all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the same Laws and Rules of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline; and therefore, in his Epistle to <hi>Antonianus,</hi> he tells him, that they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered <note place="margin">Ep. 52.</note> nothing in the Discipline of the Church, till they met together in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and duely weighed and considered the case of the Lapsed, and what was the fittest Temperament of Severity and Mercy to be used at that time: and least it should not be thought sufficient, to advise only with the <hi>African</hi> Bishops in so weighty an Affair, they sent to <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and his Collegues, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint them what they had done, and
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:204354:157"/> to desire their Advice and Consent, and the same Method he observed about the Controversie of baptizing Hereticks, which was fully and freely debated in the Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> an Account of which, he sent to <hi>Stephen,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to other foreign Churches; which plainly shews, that they thought themselves obliged, as far as possibly they could, to do all things with mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Advice and Consent.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If it so fell out, as it often does in matters of mere Prudence and Order, that they differed in their Judgments of things, yet they were bound to preserve the Unity of the Church, neither to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Communion to others, nor to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake their Communion upon such ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts. Thus St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> tells the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, met in the Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> about baptizing Hereticks, <note n="*" place="margin">Superest ut de hâc ipsa re sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guli quid sentiamus, profera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem judicantes, aut à jure communionis, aliquem, fi diverfum senserit, amoventes. <hi>Cypr.

                  </note>
                  <hi>That they should all speak their Minds freely, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no man, nor denying Communion to him, if he differed from them in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> And in his Epistle to <hi>Stephen,</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Rome,</hi> observes, <note n="|" place="margin">Caeterùm scimus quosdam quod semel imbiberint nol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le deponere, nec propositum suum facile mutare, sed salvo inter col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legas pacis &amp; concordiâ vinculo, quaedam propria, quae apud se se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel sint usurpata retinere. <hi>Cyp. ad Steph.

               </p>
               <p>And in his next Epistle to <hi>Jubaianus,</hi> he says, * <hi>He is resolved not to contend with his</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Nos quantum in nobis est, prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter haereticos cum collegis &amp; co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>episcopis nostris non contendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, cum quibus divinam con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordiam, &amp; dominicam pacem tenemus;—Servatur à nobis patienter &amp; firmiter charitas ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi, collegii honor, vinculum fidei, &amp; corcordia sacerdotii. <hi>Cypr.

                  <hi>Collegues and Fellow-Bishops, for the sake of Hereticks,</hi> but if any Difference happens, <hi>He will patiently and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely preserve true Love and Charity in his mind, the Honour of the Colledge, the Bond of Faith, and the Concord of the Episcopal Office.</hi> Methinks this does not sound like an absolute Independency of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.</p>
               <p>In his Epistle to <hi>Antonianus,</hi> he tells him, <hi>That formerly there were some in his Province, who would not receive Adulter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to the Peace and Communion of the Church, nor allow them any place for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, yet did not separate from the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their Bishops, nor break the Peace of the Church, through their Obstinacy or
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:204354:158"/> inflexible Severity of Discipline;</hi> and adds, <note n="*" place="margin">Manente concordiae vinculo, &amp; perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rante Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicae Ecclesiae individuo Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, actum suum disponit &amp; dirigit unusquisque Episcopus, rationem propositi sui domino redditurus. <hi>Cypr.

                  <hi>That while the bond of Concord, and the undivided Sacrament of the Catholick Church, is preserved and maintained; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Bishop orders and governs his own Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, so as he must give an account to his Lord for it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For this Reason, St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> writes so <note place="margin">Epist. ad <hi>Pompeium,</hi> 74.</note> sharply against <hi>Stephen,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> because he was not contented to enjoy his own Opinion and Practice, but threatned to excommunicate the <hi>African</hi> Bishops, who disowned the Baptism of Hereticks; and this was the best Excuse St. <hi>Augustin</hi> could make for St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> that though he was mistaken in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet he was no Schismatick, but maintained the Peace and Unity of the Church, notwithstanding those diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Opinions and Practices.</p>
               <p>Upon a like account <hi>Irenaeus</hi> reproves <hi>Victor,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> for excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating the <hi>Asiatick</hi> Churches, because they adhered to their ancient Custom of observing <hi>Easter,</hi> very different from the custom of the <hi>Latin</hi> Churches, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Euseb.</hi> Hist. Eccl. <hi>l. 5. cap.</hi> 24.</note> whereas they might both retain their
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:204354:158"/> peculiar Customes without Schism, and so they had done many years, and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cably communicated with one another, and particularly instances in <hi>Anicetus</hi> and <hi>Polycarp,</hi> who had some kind dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute about it, and though neither of them could perswade the other to alter the Custom of his Church, yet commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated together with all the expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Love and Unity, insomuch that <hi>Anicetus</hi> allowed <hi>Polycarp</hi> to consecrate in his own Church at <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, if we lay all these together, we shall easily perceive, what little foundation there is in any thing St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> has said, for the Independency of Bishops; for it amounts to no more but this, that in matter of Discipline and Ecclesiastical Government, some Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops may differ from others in matters of less moment, for which they ought not to be deposed nor excommunicated, while they preserve the Peace and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church, and maintain Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with their Fellow Bishops; which necessarily supposes, that Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Communion is as indispensible a Duty among Bishops, as Brotherly Communion is among other Christians; which plainly overthrows Episcopal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:204354:159"/> and proves that there is but one Church, and one Communion, since there is but one Episcopal Office, whereby this one Church is ruled and governed; and that all Bishops are bound to live in Communion with each other.</p>
               <p>I shall briefly urge but one thing more to prove that the Unity of the Christian Church consists in one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and that is from the nature of Church censures. Excommunication casts a man out of the visible Society of Christ's Church, not of this or that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church only, but of the whole Christian Church; that as Baptism makes a man a member of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Church, and gives him right to Christian Communion in all the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the World, where he can enjoy it without sin, so Excommunication debats men from Christian Communion in all Churches; he that is cast out of one Church, is thereby cast out of all, and separated from the Body of Christ, which is but one. It is a very dilute explication of Church-censures, to say only, that it was a Law and Custom, in order to preserve Peace and corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence between several Churches,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:204354:159"/> that no Church should admit to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion those which were excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by another, or did Schismatically divide: It was indeed forbid by the ancient Canons to receive those into Communion, who had been excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by another Church, which lived in Catholick Communion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out satisfaction first given to that Church; but this was not meerly an arbitrary term of Concord, as it is among Confederate Princes, that one shall not entertain those who are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells to the other, but it is an essential part of Catholick Communion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which Excommunication can have no effect, nor any thing terrible in it. That which makes Excommunication so dreadful a Sentence, is, that it cuts men off from the Body of Christ, which, when duely administred, cuts them off from all communion with Christ, and from all hopes of Salvation; for it was universally acknowledged by the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, that out of the Church there is no Salvation; that Christ hath but one Body, and is the Saviour only of his Body, and that the power of the Keys, which Christ committed to his Apostles and their Successors, signifies
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:204354:160"/> Authority to receive into the Church, and to cast out; and when men are, for just and weighty reasons, cast out of the visible Communion of Christ's Church, they are separated from Christ; what is thus bound on Earth, is bound in Heaven, and therefore such men are out of a state of Salvation, as a wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed branch which is lopt off from the Tree, receives no longer any Life and nourishment from the Root; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what the Sentence of Death is in the State, that the Sentence of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication is in the Church; Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Death cuts men off from the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Mankind, Excommunication cuts them off from the Communion and Society of Christians in this World, and, if duely executed, from all the Rewards of the next, unless by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of a serious repentance they reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Peace of the Church again.</p>
               <p>But now, unless Excommunication cuts men off from the whole Body of Christians, as well as from that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church wherein they dwelt, it is as very a Scare-crow indeed as most Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians in our dayes think it to be: for, if after they are cast out of one Church, they have right to communicate in other
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:204354:160"/> Churches, then they are the Members of the Body of Christ still, and have a right to all the Priviledges of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and Excommunication signifies no more, than for a man to be turned out of one Family upon some pike and quarrel, and immediately received into another, and it may be a better.</p>
               <p>If Excommunication does not cast men out of the Catholick Communion of Christians, then men who are cast out of one Church have yet a right to communicate in others, and then those Canons which forbid receiving such who are excommunicated out of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to maintain Peace and Concord among all Churches, incroach upon the Rights of Christians, and deny Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion to those to whom they cannot lawfully deny it.</p>
               <p>Whoever reads <hi>Synesius</hi> his Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of <hi>Andronicus,</hi> can hardly imagine, that the debarring the Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate from the Communion of all Churches, as well as of that Church which excommunicated them, should be a mere Ecclesiastical Law.

I command all, both private men and publick Magistrates, to separate them both from their bed and board, and especially Bishops, who shall neither salute them while they live, nor bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them when they dye; and if any one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spises the Censures of this little Church, and receives those to Communion, who are condemned by her, as if there were no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of obeying a poor Church, let such a man know, that he divides the Church, which Christ will have to be but one, and whether he be Deacon, Presbyter, or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, he shall be to us as</hi> Andronicus <hi>is, neither will we ever give him our hand, or eat with him, much less, communicate with these in the Sacred Mysteries of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, who have any thing to do with</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dronicus <hi>and</hi> Thoantes.</p>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:204354:161"/>
               <p>This is the true Spirit of the Ancient Discipline, and therefore to prevent Abuses of this kind, when any consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Persons were excommunicated, they sent advice of it to other Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and where there was no notice giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, they would not receive any Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, whether Lay or Clergy, into the Communion of the Church where they came, till they produced their formed or communicatory Letters from the Church from whence they came, that thereby they might know whether they were owned by that Church, and were in Communion with it.

               <p>HAving, in the former Chapter suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently proved, that the Unity of the Catholick Church consists in one Communion, to prepare the way, for what follows, I shall make some few
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:204354:162"/> Remarks oh what I have already dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd.</p>
               <p>As first, That to be in Communion with any Church signifies to be a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of it: for Christian Communion is nothing else but Christian Fellowship and Society; and to be in Church-Fellowship is to be a Member of a Church.</p>
               <p>None were ever allowed Christian Communion but those who were first Christians, that is, received into the Society of Christ's Church, by Baptism made Members of his Body: Christian Communion was confined to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church, and was not common to Pagans and Infidels.</p>
               <p>And every Member of the Christian Church, who is not under Church-cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, was always thought to have equal Right and equal Obligation to all parts of Christian Communion; there was no such thing as partial, or <hi>occasional Communion</hi> known in the ancient Church: for men, suppose, to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate in hearing Sermons, and not to communicate in Prayers or Sacraments, nor submit to Church Order and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, or one day to communicate in one Church, and all the year after to

               <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s <hi>Catholick Christian</hi> was never heard of till Mr. <hi>B.</hi> made the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery; neither the Ancient Church, nor our old Non-conformists take any notice of those Catholick Christians, who can communicate with a Church, and separate from it at the same time; whose <hi>Catholicism</hi> consists in communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating <hi>occasionally</hi> (that is, as the toy takes them, or as it will serve an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est) with all the several Sects and Parties of Christians, without living in Communion with any of them; and it is an admirable resolution Mr. <hi>B.</hi> makes in the name of his <hi>mere Non-conformists, and we will be members of no particular Church which alloweth us not occasional Communion with others, but take such for</hi>

                  <hi>Sectaries,</hi> that is, with other Churches
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:204354:163"/> of distinct and separate Communions; so that, according to Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Principles, those men are Sectaries who allow but <hi>one Catholick Church,</hi> and <hi>one Catholick Communion</hi> in that one Church; and the onely way to avoid being particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Sectaries, is to be Catholick Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, not to confine themselves to one Communion, but to take their turns occasionally in all. This <hi>Baxterian Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi> is nothing else but a <hi>Protean Religionist,</hi> who transforms himself into all shapes, and differs from the <hi>Hobbist</hi> only in this, that the <hi>Hobbist</hi> is for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alwayes of his Prince's Religion, but he is alwayes for being against it; for if any one Religion be established by Publick Authority to the disallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all others, that must be <hi>Sectari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anism,</hi> and our Catholick Christian can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a <hi>Sectarian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, I observe farther, that that is a Schismatical Communion, which does not make us Members of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church; for if there be but one Church, and one Communion, then to live in Communion with any Church which is not a Member of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, nor makes up one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with it, is Schism; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:204354:163"/> Independency, in the very nature of it, is a Schism; for every Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Congregation is a distinct Church, and has a distinct Communion of its own: no man is made a Member of all Independent Congregations, by being a Member of one, for their Church-membership depends upon a particular, explicit Church-Covenant between Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor and People, which can reach no farther than that particular Church to which it was made; nor is their Pastor a Minister of the Universal Church, but of that particular Church which chose him for their Pastor; and therefore, when he preaches to other Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Churches, he preaches only as a gifted Brother, and not as Pastor; so that there are as many distinct Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and Churches, as there are Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Congregations, which are not Members of each other, and hold no Communion with each other but upon courtesie, and therefore are all Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks.</p>
               <p>And wherever there are distinct and separate Communions and Churches, which do not own Church-membership with each other, but though they live in the same place, yet divide into seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:204354:164"/> distinct Congregations, under diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Governours, and opposite Orders and Rules, there is certainly a Schism on one side or other: where there are two distinct and opposite Communions, one of them must be Schismatical, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there ought to be but one.</p>
               <p>For nothing can be more wild than Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Notion of a Catholick Church, which he every where drives at; that the Catholick Church is nothing else but either the whole number of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians professing the Faith of Christ, all the World over, without any respect to Church Communion; or that the Catholick Church is made up of all the several Sects and combinations of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, without respect to <hi>one Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Thus he declares the sense of his <hi>mere Non-conformist. We hold we must separate from no Church or Christian far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than they separate from Christ, though we must not sin against God for communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with any. We take it for a great sin for</hi>

                  <hi>any Party to appropriate the Church only to themselves</hi> (but it is no sin to make Parties, so they do not Schismatically appropriate the Church onely to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves) <hi>we own no Church but as part of the Catholick (or Ʋniversal) Church,</hi> that is, all the distinct and opposite Churches
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:204354:164"/> and Communions, are parts and Branches of the Universal Church, w<seg rend="sup">ch</seg>, at this rate, can be no better, than a mere chimerical notion, one Communion made up of a hundred separate &amp; opposite Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; a Body made up of several Members, which are at a great Distance from each other, and of such a different Make and Frame, that they cannot possibly be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: Yes, says Mr. <hi>B.</hi> we are united to all Churches, (and he tells us how) <hi>And we hold all our Assemblies as in Ʋnion and Communion with all the true Churches on Earth;</hi> if it were not for that <hi>as,</hi> this would be somthing to the purpose, to clear them from the guilt of <hi>Schism, that they hold their Assemblies in Ʋnion and Communion with all true Churches on Earth.</hi> But I fear, <hi>as in Ʋnion,</hi> may signifie as out of Union, but as it were in Union.</p>
               <p>As for Instance, How do our present Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters <hi>hold their Assemblies, as in union and Communion with the Church of</hi> England? Why truly, as if they were out of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with her; for I would desire any man to tell me, how we may more perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Communion of any Church, and set up distinct and opposite Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, than our Dissenters have done. If forming Churches under new and distinct Officers, with new Rules and Methods of
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:204354:165"/> Worship and Discipline, without any Dependance on the publick Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, be to live as in Union and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> by the magical vertue of this, as they may be said to hold their Assemblies in Union and Communion with the Papists and Quakers, and Independents, whom they formerly accused of Schism and Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. What invisible kind of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion he may mean, I know not; but, Church Communion is such a visible Fellowship, as is necessary to make a visible Society, and such Communion we cannot see, no not with the Help of Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s <hi>Spectacles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But he adds, <hi>and</hi> (we) <hi>put up our Prayers and Praises as in Conjunction with theirs, not owning their Failings (or our own) but their Duties;</hi> this, <hi>as in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction,</hi> is like praising men with a <hi>but,</hi> which spoils all; for it is an odd kind of <hi>Conjunction,</hi> when they will not so much as use the same Words in Prayer with us, nor pray in the same place, nor at the same time neither, were it not to prevent all <hi>Conjunction.</hi> And therefore, what he means by putting up their Prayers, <hi>as in Conjunction,</hi> with others, I cannot imagine, since Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:204354:165"/> in Prayers either signifies Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together, and putting up our Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in common for us all, or praying, though at distant places, yet in Unity and Concord, and Christian Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that is, in the External Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church; and thus Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, who divide the Church, can never pray in Conjunction with the Christian Church, and let them then make the best they can of their, <hi>as in conjunction.</hi> But what he adds is the prettiest fetch of all, whereby he would perswade us, that they separate no more from other Churches, than they do from themselves, <hi>not owning their failings (nor our own) but their Duties:</hi> which words, if they have any sense, must signifie, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they <hi>own their Duties,</hi> that is, that Prayer, and Preaching, and singing Psalms, and receiving the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, are necessary Duties of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but disown <hi>their failings,</hi> that is, their manner of performing these Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and therefore cannot joyn in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Worship, yet they put up their Prayers and Praises <hi>in conjunction</hi> with them: as if Christian Communion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted in owning Christian Duties, not in joyning in them.

               <p>Thirdly, I observe farther, that <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal, Local, Praesential</hi> Communion, is not the entire notion of Christian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:204354:167"/> nor essential to the Notion of a Church. For then there can be no Catholick Church, nor Catholick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion all the World over, for the Christians, who are dispersed all the World over: can never enjoy <hi>Personal</hi> and <hi>Presential</hi> Communion with each other, that is, cannot all meet together to worship God at the same time, in the same place, and to discharge those other Acts of Christian Communion, which require their personal presence with each other. And yet the Catholick Church is more properly a Church, than any particular Churches, which are called Churches, only as they are Branches and Members of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church; for it is the Catholick Church which is the Body of Christ, and particular Churches and particular Christians are the Members of Christ's Body, as they are Members of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Church.</p>
               <p>The entire Notion of Christian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, contains all those Duties and Offices which all Christians are bound to perform, whether they respect the Worship of God, or that relation they stand in to each other, as Members of the same Body: some of which we owe
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:204354:167"/> to all Christians, all the World over, and therefore may and must be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, when we are absent from one another; others require the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Christian Assemblies for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of Religious Worship, others al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of such convenient distance as will admit of the Communion of Discipline and Government: which, in few cases, was to be confined to the next Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, or the compass of personal Conversation, and there is as little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son it should be thus confined in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical as in Civil Governments.</p>
               <p>That <hi>praesential and personal</hi> Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which is necessary to the Being of a Church, as it is a religious Society for divine Worship, must be performed by parts, in the Assemblies of neighbour Christians, who meet together to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship God and their Saviour, and hold Communion with all other religious Assemblies and Christian Churches. This, as Dr. <hi>O.</hi> well observes, <hi>The very</hi>

                  <hi>nature of the thing requires,</hi> but if Christ hath instituted but one Church, and one Communion all the World over, there is something more than this <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential Communion</hi> necessary to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of the Church, which Dr. <hi>O.</hi>
                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:204354:168"/> himself owns, that there is something more required to the Constitution of a Church, than <hi>An Assembly for divine</hi>

                  <hi>which have not, or which cannot have As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies for divine Worship, are not Churches properly so called,</hi> which though he says, <hi>need not here be insisted on,</hi> was indeed, the only thing which wanted proof: For the Universal Church is much more properly a Church, than any particular Churches, which are but Parts and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it; and yet cannot have such an Universal Assembly for Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; but must have particular Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies for that purpose: and then I would desire any man to shew me, why par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches, which are under one Government or Discipline, may not consist of several particular religious Assemblies, or parochial Churches? If this be contrary to the Notion of a Church, then there cannot be one Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church and Catholick Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; if it be not contrary to the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Church, how does it destroy the nature of particular Churches?</p>
               <p>Were it as impossible, by the care of several parochial Ministers, and the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:204354:168"/> Inspection and Government of one Bishop, to exercise true Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Discipline in a Diocesan Church, as it is for all the Christians in one Diocese to meet ordinarily together for religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Worship, I would readily yield the Cause; but if it be very practicable to govern a much larger Society than can ordinarily meet for Worship, the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will not hold from the necessity of particular Assemblies for religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, to prove that Church Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on must be no larger than a religious Assembly; which, by the way, also shews, how fond that Conceit is, that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor of every particular Congregation, must <hi>have all the Powers of Teaching and Ruling by the Word and Keys,</hi> and that <hi>every single Congregation, must have full Power to reform it self.</hi> I grant this Power must be in every Church, in some Measure, but it does not hence follow, that it must reside in every Pastor and single Congregation, because a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church may be of a larger Extent than the Bounds of a single Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and then a particular Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being not an entire Church, but part of a Church, there is no reason it should be invested with the whole pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:204354:169"/> of the Church; you may as well say, that every Family must have the whole power of the Kingdom for the Government of it's self. The Master of the Family has so much Power over his Children and Servants, as is necessary for the orderly Government of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; but such Crimes as fall under the Cognizance of a higher Power, must be referred to their proper Judicatures. Thus the Pastor of particular parochial Churches, has Power to reprove, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish, instruct, exhort, and to absolve Penitents, who are under no Church-Censures, and in the danger of Death, <note place="margin">See Dr. <hi>Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet</hi>'s Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness of Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no. p. 272. § 14, 15, 16, 17.</note> though they are, and to suspend from the Table of our Lord, giving a timely account to his Bishop, why he does so; and this is all the Discipline which is absolutely necessary in a Parochial Church, reserving the Judicial Censures of the Church to the proper Seat of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Authority.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I observe farther, That it is not at the choice of particular Christians, to communicate with what Church they please, but they are bound to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with that part of the Catholick Church, wherein they live.</p>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:204354:169"/>
               <p>The Reason of this is very plain; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is but one Church, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Christian is bound to communicate with this one Church; and there is no way to maintain Communion with the Catholick Church, but by communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with some part of it; and to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate causelessly from any one part of the Catholick Church, is to break the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the whole, which is one by the Communion of all it's Parts and Members: and therefore willfully or wantonly to refuse Communion with that part of the Church wherein we live, is a Schism from the whole.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> has every where in his late Books advanced a great many odd Principles to justifie Separation, which (if what I have already discoursed hold good, that there is but one Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, united by one Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Communion) must of necessity be false; as to name some which fall under this Head.</p>
               <p>He supposes, that men may separate from particular Churches, without se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating from the Catholick Church. <hi>It is one thing to separate from the Ʋni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal</hi>

Thus St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> denied Communion to <hi>Maximus,</hi> a Presbyter, and <hi>Augendus,</hi> a <hi>Deacon,</hi> and <hi>Machaeus</hi> and <hi>Longinus,</hi> who were <note place="margin">

<pb n="250" facs="tcp:204354:171"/> part of the Body, but not from the whole Body, as that a Christian may separate from every particular Church, and not separate from, (which I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose he means by <hi>renouncing) the Church Ʋniversal,</hi> unless he can find another Body, besides all its parts, and an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal Church, besides all particular Churches.</p>
               <p>But the fundamental mistake, which runs him into so many other of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is this, <hi>that reception into a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The true and only way of concord, p. 135.</note>
                  <hi>Church is no work of Baptism, as such, but a consequent act (in order of nature alwayes, and often of time) the Eunuch,</hi> Acts 8. <hi>was baptized into no Church but the Ʋniversal;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though he acknowledges, that <hi>it is very fit</hi> (I perceive he dares not say necessary) <hi>that every one that can, be a member of some particular Church; yet Baptism, as such, is no such thing, nor hath such an effect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that, it seems, a man may be a Christian, without being a Member of any Christian Church; or, at least, may be a member of the Universal Church, without being a Member of any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church; a member of the whole
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:204354:171"/> Body, without being united to any part of the Body.</p>
               <p>But if Baptism be an external and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Sacrament of our admission into the visible Church, it necessarily exacts from us visible Communion, and we cannot have a visible Communion with a Metaphysical Notion of an <hi>Eutopian</hi> Universal Church, but must communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with some visible part of it. I would fain know, whether Baptism makes us Members of the Universal Church? if it does, then it obliges us to all the Duties and Offices of Church-members, and they are comprehended <hi>in visible Communion,</hi> when it can be had, and so makes us members of some Church wherewith we may communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate visibly: If it does not, I would willingly know, what Mr. <hi>B.</hi> means by being <hi>baptized into the Ʋniversal Church?</hi> Not that I think Baptism makes us mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of any one particular Church, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradistinct from all others, but so makes us Members of the Universal Church, that we are bound to communicate with any part of the Catholick Church, where we are, that is, with any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church which is in Catholick Communion: and therefore, for our
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:204354:172"/> ordinary Communion, we are bound to communicate with that part of the Church where we live; and in case we travel into Foreign Countreys, where there are any truly Catholick Churches, we are bound to communicate with them also, while we tarry there, and have right to it, as we are Members of the Universal Church; for this particular Church-membership is a Schismatical notion, destructive of Catholick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
               <p>Upon the same mistake, he leaves it at the free choice of every particular Christian, what Church he will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with, and how far. Part of his definition of <hi>a single Church, is, a</hi>

                  <hi>Society of Christians associated by consent,</hi> and upon this account calls them <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunteers:</hi> Now so far he is in the right, that no man can be a Christian but by his own consent; but when a man has consented to be a Christian, and is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by Baptism, there is no new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent required to make him a Member of a Church, and to oblige him to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Communion, if he resolve to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a Christian. Christian Churches are not <hi>voluntary Associations,</hi> but a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Institution; and when Christ has
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:204354:172"/> instituted but one Church, there is no choice in the case, we must either be members of that one Church, or of none at all. Men ought not indeed, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> speaks, <hi>be forced into a Temple, not consenting, for then it is a Prison, and they are not a Church;</hi> but if they do not joyn in all those acts of Christian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, to which their Baptism and profession of Christianity obliges them, they ought to be thrown out of the Church again, as those who renounce their Christian Profession; which is a much better way to make men sensible of their obligation to <hi>Christian Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> then as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> sayes, to <hi>make them</hi>

               <p>Such another mistake it is, when he founds the Church-relation between Pastor and People, upon the Peoples voluntary choice and consent to take <note place="margin">

<pb n="254" facs="tcp:204354:173"/> their particular Choice and Election, but on that Authority Christ hath giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to his Ministers, to instruct and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern his Church; and when men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to be Christ's Disciples, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to submit to that Authority Christ hath instituted in his Church. Though we should suppose, that no Bishop can regularly be ordained without the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples consent, which can never be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, yet it is not the Peoples consent, but his Ordination which gives him that Authority in the Church. Baptism and the visible Profession of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, without any farther consent makes such men Christ's Flock, and obliges them to obey their Spiritual Guides and Pastors; and Ordination, according to Christ's Institution, makes others Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Presbyters, and invests them with Authority to instruct and govern, and this is the foundation of a Church-Relation.</p>
               <p>But, sayes Mr. <hi>B.</hi> in the Person of the <hi>meer Non-conformists, we think that all</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Search for the Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat. <hi>p.</hi> 32.</note>
                  <hi>Churches should prefer a faithful Pastor before an unfaithful and insufficient one, and a purer Church before a more corrupt:</hi> which, if it signifies any thing to justifie their Schism, fairly insinuates, that Non-conformists
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:204354:173"/> are the most faithful Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, and Conventicles the purest Churches; the usual Complements they pass upon themselves, and the Church of <hi>England.</hi> But to let that pass, no doubt but Christians, when they may, must choose the faithfullest Pastors, and the purest Churches. What then? Why then they may choose Schismatical Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, if they judge them the most faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and set up Schismatical Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles for the sake of a purer Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This was the very Argument of the <hi>Novatians</hi> and <hi>Donatists,</hi> but not thought sufficient to justifie their Schism, either by St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> or St. <hi>Austin:</hi> and that for this reason, because there is but one Church, and we must not go out of the Church to seek for faithful Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, or a purer Communion. As far as this may be done with the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Catholick Unity and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, we may, and ought to do it; but we must separate from no Church where we can communicate without sin, though some Pastors may be less faithful or suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient; or there may be some less ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial corruptions in its Worship or Discipline. Christians must preserve themselves as pure as may be in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:204354:174"/> Communion, but must still be careful to hold Communion with the Catholick Church, by communicating with that part of it where they dwell, and to set up distinct Churches merely for some greater degrees of purity, is a Schism from the Universal Church, as it divides and separates the Commun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I shall take notice but of one Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction more, which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> makes to qualifie and extenuate the Evil of Separation, and that is between local and mental Separation; <hi>It is one thing to separate locally by bodily Absence, and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Plea for Peace, p. 38. Search for the Schis. p. 6.</note>
                  <hi>another mentally by schismatical Principles.</hi> This he urges in several places, and flies to, as a safe Retreat, upon all occasions; and makes it to be no more than what is often, and indeed too often, practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in <hi>London,</hi> and elsewhere, by those who leave their Parish Churches, and communicate with other Parish Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. Now I grant there is a Difference between local and mental Separation, but I think it will do Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> no great Service to justifie his Schism; for if this local Separation be for the sake of a distinct and separate Communion, it is schismatical; if it be not, it may be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:204354:174"/> but not Schismatical: As for Instance.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> separates <hi>locally</hi> from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> when he prays and preaches in Conventicles, and this is schismatical; not because his Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle is in one place, and the Parish-Church in another, for so all Parish-Churches are locally distant and separate; but because his Conventicle is a separate Communion, set up in Distinction or Opposition to the Church of <hi>England.</hi> But those who leave their own Parish Churches, and go to other Parish-Churches in the same Communion, tho they are disorderly in it, unless upon some great Occasions, yet they are not schismatical, because they do not go out of the Communion of the Church. The Difference between these two sorts of men, is like the difference between a Souldier's breaking his Rank, and his forsaking his Colours, and revolting to the Enemy; they are both indeed lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Separations, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> says, but yet one is Wantonness or Folly, the other Treason.</p>
               <p>So that this distinction between <hi>local</hi> and <hi>mental Separation,</hi> is very illogical and fallacious, because the parts of it
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:204354:175"/> are not distinct: local Separation may be mental also, upon schismatical Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, as all that Separation is, which divides Communion, when men set up distinct and separate Churches or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles: but when men do not break the Communion of the Church, as those do not, who only go from one Parish-Church to another, it is only local and not mental, or upon schismatical Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. And on the other hand, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever mental, schismatical Principles men have, if they do not locally separate, that is, if they do not divide into sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Communions, they are not formal Schismaticks: and though these mental Schismaticks, who divide upon schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Principles, should not always separate locally, but sometimes hold oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casional Communion with our Parish-Churches, yet they are nevertheless Schismaticks for all that.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, I observe farther, that tho the Bonds and Combinations of several Churches are ordered and determined by humane Prudence, yet they are founded on a divine Right. The Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church is as much of divine Right, as any form of Government in it; and when the whole Church must
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:204354:175"/> be but one, it may be divided into greater or lesser parts, as may best serve the preservation of Unity, Peace, and Order, and the Edification of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</p>
               <p>When Christ hath instituted a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, and Catholick Unity, it seems strange to me, that a national or patriarchal Church (which is only such a Combination of several Churches into one, as may serve the ends of Catholick Unity) should not be thought as much a divine Institution, as any particular Church.</p>
               <p>When Christ and his Apostles have instituted one Form of Government for all particular Churches, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them all to live in Unity, and Peace, and Communion, and amicable Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence with each other, the Union and Combination of several Churches into one, according to this Institution, and to serve the ends of Catholick Communion, must be thought as much a divine Institution, as the Bounds of particular Churches: for if we will not allow those Churches to be of divine Institution, which have Officers of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Appointment, and are formed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the general Directions of
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:204354:176"/> Christ and his Apostles, so as may serve the ends of Church Communion, I know not where we can find a Church of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Institution in the World.</p>
               <p>As for example; Suppose a Church governed by a Parochial Bishop, with three or four Presbyters and Deacons for his assistance, and Chappels of ease, according to the number of their Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, be an Episcopal Church, of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Institution, according to Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Model, and (as he sayes) the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive pattern; I would desire to know, if the number of Souls should so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, or the wants of them be so great, that this Bishop, without enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the bounds of his Bishoprick, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of four, should need forty Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters and Deacons, and as many Chappels of ease for his assistance, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this would be <hi>a new species of Churches?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Authority of the Bishop over forty Presbyters, and over four, is the same kind of Authority, though of larger extent, and therefore the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning Right and Power of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as Presbyters, is as much invaded where there are but four subject Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, as where there are forty: <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:204354:176"/> and <hi>Presential</hi> Communion can no more be had in a Parish, which consists of such multitudes of Christians, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire four Chappels of Ease, besides the Mother Church, as if there were forty; and as for that new Notion he has started, of <hi>present,</hi> or <hi>presential Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A second Defence of the No conf. against Dr. <hi>Stillingfl.</hi> p. 100.</note> which is not present, where all do not <hi>meet at one place at once</hi> (as he observes <hi>the tenth part of some Parish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, cannot) but as Neighbours and Citizens may have personal converse and meetings,</hi> per vices, <hi>of some at one time, and some at another.</hi> This may be had also were there forty Chappels of Ease, (or in the language of our Church, Parishes, with fix'd, subject Presbyters to instruct and govern them) if it be thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to the constitution of a Church; and by the vigilancy of one Bishop, and many subject Presbyters, a Church of a much larger extent may be well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed and governed, as he himself acknowledges it was at <hi>Carthage in St. Cyprian's time (a place of greatness, and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
                  <hi>great number of Christians) where the Church was grown very great, but</hi> (as he supposes, in favour of his own hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis) <hi>not beyond the exercise of such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Communion.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="262" facs="tcp:204354:177"/>
               <p>So that there can be no specifical dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Parochial Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopacy and Diocesan Episcopacy, but only as to the case of <hi>present Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> (of which more hereafter) unless he only allow the name of a <hi>Bishop</hi> without the Authority and Superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which Bishops have alwayes challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged over Presbyters in the first and purest Ages of the Church, before <hi>worldly reasons have made a change,</hi> as he alwayes speaks to the reproach of Christianity, even in the purest Ages of it; which he matters not much, so it will but justifie his own Faction.</p>
               <p>The plain truth is, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> talks so uncertainly and variously in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that it is very hard to understand what he would have; if you charge him with opposing <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> this he denies, for he is for a <hi>Parochial Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,</hi> a Bishop over every Parish or Congregation, where they can enjoy <hi>present Communion;</hi> For thus <hi>God hath appointed that there shall be stated Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of Christians, especially on the Lord's Day, where he shall be worshipped, men instructed, and Communion exercised. That these Congregations should have known stated Pastors, to be their Teachers and

                  <hi>their Pastors, by their Office, have the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Church-Keys, to judge whom to take in by Baptism, and whom to admonish as criminal, to reject as impenitent, and to absolve and receive again as penitent, in their proper charge</hi> And thus he has only changed the name, and every Parish Minister is a Bishop, and from Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians, they are transformed into Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopal Divines.</p>
               <p>Well, But must this Parish Bishop <note place="margin">Plea for Peace, <hi>p.</hi> 13 §. 10.</note> have the care of one or more Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations? But of one sure, wherein all the Members may enjoy <hi>present</hi> and <hi>lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Communion,</hi> such <hi>Assemblies</hi> where <hi>God may be worshipped, men instructed, and Communion exercised.</hi> But how does this agree with the Primitive Form of Episcopacy, when it is evident, from all the Records of Church-history, even in the Apostles times, that there were more Christians in one Church, than could assemble together at one time for acts of Worship, as it was in the Church of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and <hi>Corinth,</hi> to name no more? To avoid this, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larges the notion of <hi>present Communion,</hi> which, he sayes, does not require, <hi>that</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Answer to Dr. <hi>Still.</hi> p. 100.</note>

                  <hi>per vices, some at one time, and some at another:</hi> for they must all hold present and personal Communion with their Bishop, and the Congregation of which they are Members; though indeed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own way, they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver communicate in acts of worship with the whole Congregation at a time; and therefore, unless they change their turns prudently, may never, in all their life have present Communion with the tenth part of their Church or Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; which yet is as essential to the constitution of a Parochial Episcopacy, as to communicate with their Pastor, or Parish Bishop.</p>
               <p>But what shall those supernumerary Christians do, who cannot meet at the Parish for ordinary and constant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion? Here Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is a little uncertain what to determine: He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows them other Meetings, like our <note place="margin">Plea for Peace, <hi>p.</hi> 13.</note> Chappels of Ease in many Parishes, in dependance on the Mother Church, and under the Government of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish Bishop; and therefore, elsewhere, makes a Minister of a large Parish, with several Curates under him, to be a primitive Bishop with his Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters.</p>
               <pb n="265" facs="tcp:204354:178"/>
               <p>But now the difficulty is, what Church-Officers these Curates are: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be subject Presbyters or not? if they be, then here is a Diocesan Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop and his Presbyters: for the Form of Government is the same with four, as with forty subject Presbyters; If they be not, (as I know not how they should be, if there be no such Officer <note place="margin">Plea for Peace, <hi>p.</hi> 15. 16.</note> as a subject Presbyter, of Divine or Apostolical Institution, as he seems to think) they must either be Bishops or Deacons: a Deacon is not sufficiently qualified to be a Bishop's Curate in a distinct Chappel or Congregation, where all Acts of Religious Worship must be performed, as well as in the Parish Church; and it is a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment upon the Episcopal Office, to make one Bishop, of equal Power and Authority, Curate to another.</p>
               <p>And therefore, to remove this diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, in another place he explains him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self either otherwise, or more at large, (for I know not well which it is, and therefore will not affirm either.)

                  <hi>Pastor</hi> of the Church, but the Bishop; if the latter, it is vastly different from the primitive Government, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver acknowledged but one Bishop in a Church; though we should grant him (of which possibly more hereafter) two Bishops sometimes in a City.</p>
               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:204354:179"/>
               <p>Secondly, I would desire to know, whether these six conjunct <hi>Pastors</hi> over 6000 Souls, have six particular Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, with such particular Souls under their proper care, like our Parish-Churches, with a fixed Parish Minister over them? if they have, why are they not six distinct Churches, with their Parochial Bishops, independent on each other, but by mutual consent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federation? why must the people be bound to run from one Church to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, to enjoy, by turns, present Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with each other? why should not every particular Bishop have the power of Censures and Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and all parts of Discipline in his own hands?</p>
               <p>If the Bounds and Precincts, or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes (call them what you please) be not divided, but lye in common, in whom does the Power and Authority reside? if equally in all, how can Mr. <hi>B.</hi> be sure that six will agree in the same thing? Does not this lay a foundation of Schism in the Church? to prevent which (as St. <hi>Jerom</hi> owns) Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy was first instituted; if the President have a Negative Voice, is not this a Tyrannical Usurpation over his Fellow
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:204354:180"/> Bishops, who, by vertue of their Office, have the same inherent Authority with himself? if the major number of Votes must determine all Disputes, is it not a kind of sacrilegious desertion of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, for any Bishop to be over-ruled in matters of Discipline, as it would be to suffer himself to be silenced by his Fellow Bishops? to be a Titular Bishop without the power of Government, but when his Fellow Bishops give him leave; is not such a Bishop as much a <hi>carkass</hi> of a mortified Bishop, as those Congregations are the <hi>carkasses of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to Dr. <hi>Still.</hi> p. 99.</note>
                  <hi>particular Churches,</hi> who have not all Episcopal Power exercised by their particular Pastors?</p>
               <p>Such kind of Arguments as these Mr. <hi>B.</hi> urges against Diocesan Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, but they return with greater force upon his new Form of Church-government by conjunct Pastors: for Superiority amongst Equals is liable to more inconveniences, and more obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, than different degrees and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of men in the same Church: and the reason is evident, why he rather chuses to have the Church governed by conjunct Pastors and a President, than to set an Independent Bishop over
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:204354:180"/> every particular Congregation, because he had a mind to counterfeit the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Government by Bishop and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, (since he cannot deny that that was the Ancient Form of Government) without owning any distinct Orders in the Church: that those who are not aware of the Fallacy, may believe him to be as much for Episcopal preceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as any man, till the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> were pulled down, and then his new project would be found unpra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticable, and they must return to their Presbyterian parity again.</p>
               <p>For the same reason Mr. <hi>B.</hi> sometimes <note place="margin">Plea for Peace, <hi>p.</hi> 17, 18.</note> pretends to be mightily for such Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops as <hi>Ignatius</hi> was, who (he sayes) was Bishop but of one Congregation; and <hi>such Bishops we do not oppose:</hi> Now would Mr. <hi>B.</hi> stand to this, our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie about Diocesan Bishops were quickly at an end: for every one knows, that <hi>Ignatius</hi> challenged a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority of Order over Presbyters, and does, in all his Epistles, command them to be subject to their Bishops, and to attempt nothing without him: now let him allow but such Bishops as have subject Presbyters, and the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion about the Bounds and Extent of
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:204354:181"/> Bishopricks will be more easily deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined: to be sure, he will never be able to prove that Diocesan Bishops are a new Species of Church-Officers, distinct from the <hi>Ignatian</hi> Bishops: <hi>Blondel</hi> and <hi>Dallee,</hi> and others, were so sensible of this, that they used their utmost skill to prove those Epistles to be spurious, and since they have failed in that glorious attempt, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> had best try, whether he can make <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> his Bishops and Presbyters to be <hi>conjunct Pastors with a President Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we see at last, what Mr. <hi>B's</hi> Parochial Episcopacy is, and how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Primitive Episcopacy, which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riddles that Mystery, why he should think Diocesan Episcopacy a new Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Government from Parochial Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopacy; which he every where char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges upon the large extent of a Diocese, which, when it is too large, may occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion some defects in the exercise of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, but cannot alter the Species of Government, while we retain the same degrees and orders of Governours in the Church; unless he thinks that a King, who has but a little Kingdom, does specifically differ from a King who
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:204354:181"/> governs a great many large and potent Kingdoms; whereas one may be as much a King as the other, though not so great and powerful a King: and the extent of Bishopricks being deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by no Divine Law, must be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by Humane Prudence, and therefore the Bounds of Bishopricks seem to be a very slender pretence to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie a Schism.</p>
               <p>But the plain truth is, Mr. <hi>B's</hi> Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial Episcopacy does specifically differ from Diocesan Episcopacy, because a Parochial and Diocesan Bishop and Presbyters agree in nothing but in the Name: A Diocesan (or true primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>Ignatian)</hi> Bishop, has a Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Order and Power over his Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, who may advise him, but must be subject to him, and attempt nothing in Church-government without him; for which reason St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated <hi>Felicissimus</hi> and his Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates; but Mr. <hi>B's</hi> Parochial Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have equal Authority with their President Bishop, who have no Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge above them, but to propose and moderate Debates, and number Votes, like the Chair-man of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee.</p>
               <pb n="272" facs="tcp:204354:182"/>
               <p>This indeed is Mr. <hi>B's</hi> quarrel at Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocesan Episcopacy, though he layes the blame upon the Extent of a Diocese, which is a Popular pretence; but let us first be agreed about the nature of Episcopacy, and not be cheated again into a Presbyterian parity by an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal name, and then it will be time to discourse about the Extent of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricks.</p>
               <p>And that I have not injured Mr. B. in representing his Opinion, let him speak his judgment himself in a few words.</p>

                  <hi>must determine whether a particular Church shall have one Pastor or more:</hi> So that here may be a Parochial Bishop without either Presbyters or Deacons, a thing unknown in the primitive Church; and I need not tell you what kind of Bishop this is, <hi>viz.</hi> a Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian or Independent Pastor of a single Congregation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If one for Concord be President to the rest, and the senior Pastors be guides to the younger, we are not against it.</hi> Here is his Description of a President Bishop, who, it seems, may be, or may not be, for there is no great need of him: and
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:204354:182"/> when he is made, it is for Concord not for Government, to be a Guide and Tutor to the young Bishops, though it be against the Apostolical Canon, to make such Novices Bishops as need Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nor yet if the Magistrates or Churches, by consent, appoint some of the Graver to to be Visitors of many Churches, and to instruct and keep the younger in peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nor will we quarrel against the names of Bishops, or Arch-bishops, or their Wealth and Honour, while Faith, Worship, Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and Love are preserved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These Visitors he sometimes calls Arch-bishops, sometimes <hi>Episcopi Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porum,</hi> Bishops of Bishops, which St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi> in the Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> did reject with such abhorrence, as an inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Usurpation upon the Office and Authority of a Bishop, and therefore this certainly can be no part of primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church-government.</p>
               <p>Sometimes he makes these Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops <note place="margin">Premoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the only way of Concord.</note> Successors to the Apostles in the ordinary part of their Work and Office: and so indeed Bishops were alwayes accounted the Apostles Successors, and therefore were said to fit in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles Chairs, but then they were such
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:204354:183"/> Bishops as had a Superiority of Order and Authority over their Presbyters and Deacons, without whose direction and allowance nothing might be done in Church-matters by the inferiour Clergy; and if he will allow these Arch-bishops to have such an inherent Apostolical Authority over Parish-Bishops, we will not dispute about words, but then he must not give away the full Episcopal power to his Parish-bishops.</p>
               <p>But this will not do Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s business, for this brings a Superiour Order into the Church, and destroys his darling Presbyterian Parity; and therefore he asserts, that such <hi>Arch-bishops as put down all the lower Bishops</hi> (i. e. the Parish-bishops) <hi>and govern the carkasses of the mortified particular Churches, as the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Bishops of many score, or hundred such as themselves,</hi> (that is, who exercise a true Episcopal Authority over these Parish-bishops, and their Churches) <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Species</hi> (of Churches) <hi>of God's</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Answer to Dr. <hi>Still.</hi>

                  <hi>making.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore the safest way is to make these <hi>Arch-bishops,</hi> and <hi>Diocesans,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Praemon. to the way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</note>
                  <hi>and Patriarchs, the King's Officers, to exercise under him such Government of
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:204354:183"/> the Church as belongeth to Kings,</hi> (and therefore no proper Episcopal Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which does not belong to Kings) and then <hi>they will not quarrel at the name of Bishops or Arch-bishops:</hi> but our dissenting Brethren themselves will be contented to be made such Archi-epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopal Officers of the King; and Dr. <hi>Ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> are to be the two first, according to a late ingenious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal.</p>
               <p>And thus the whole matter is out, and it appears Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s great Art has been to confound his Readers with the names of Parochial Bishops, President Bishops, Arch-bishops, Patriarchs; when all that he means by it is this, that those whom we call Presbyters, are, and should be called Bishops, and have all that Authority, which, in primitive times, Bishops challenged, as a Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Order to Presbyters, though, for Concord-sake, five or six of them may be joyned together, and act as conjunct Pastors, with a Chair-man, who shall enjoy the name of President, and Ape the primitive Government of a Bishop with his Presbyters: and these are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proper Church-Officers, but the King, if he pleases, may delegate his
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:204354:184"/> Church-power to Church-men (as King <hi>H.</hi> 8. did to my Lord <hi>Cromwel,</hi> his Vicar-general) and call them Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesans, Arch-bishops, Patriarchs, or what he will.</p>
               <p>And yet, under this disguise, he thinks to conceal himself, and to play at Bo-peep with his Readers and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerers: as to give one plain instance of this:</p>
               <p>The Dean charged him with assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Congregational-Churches to be so much</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness of Separat. Second Defence, p. 99.</note>
                  <hi>the Institution of Christ, that any other Constitution above these, is both unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and insupportable;</hi> for which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges his own words.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> in his Answer, cannot deny his own words, but endeavours to qualifie them: And first, he sayes, he did not absolutely assert it, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed it with an <hi>If: if it holdeth, that God Instituted only Congregational or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial Churches, as for present Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then none of the rest instituted by man may deprive them of their Priviledge granted by Christ: I put it but with an (if it be so) because I told them my own doubt of it. After that, I say, (to devise new Species of Churches without God's Authority, and impose them on the World,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:204354:184"/> yea, in his name, and call all Dissenters Schismaticks, is worse Ʋsurpation than to make and impose new Ceremonies and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies)</hi> which are the words whereon the Dean had very justly founded his charge: But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> thinks unjustly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was all qualified with an <hi>if,</hi> which expressed his doubt of it.</p>
               <p>But at this rate, a man may fairly insinuate all the Villanous Accusations against Church and State, and bring himself as fairly off, though he do all the mischief with his <hi>If,</hi> as if he plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly asserted the thing: for when he first industriously proves, that <hi>all Churches, excepting Parochial, are of mens devising, considered as Churches;</hi> and though there may be some Arbitrary combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Parochial Churches, such as <hi>Classical, Diocesan, Metropolitical, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial, National, Patriarchal, Papal;</hi> yet they ought not to be accounted <hi>a distinct Policy, or Church-Form; for, it is perillous to give the same name to such an Assembly or Association, as to a Church of Christ's Institution, lest it seduce men to think that the word is not equivocally used;</hi> that is, to think, that these Asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations are as true and proper Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es as Parochial Churches: I say, after
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:204354:185"/> all this, to argue from such premises with an <hi>if,</hi> does not signifie any doubt of the thing, but only a Form of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing, and drawing Consequences from it: And thus it is plainly here: for he <note place="margin">Way to concord, p. 107.</note> first proves, that Christ has instituted Congregational Churches for present Communion, and there is no other Form of Church-government, wherein present Communion can be had, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his notion of it, which he every where inculcates, and which is the foundation of his whole <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis;</hi> and he disputes at large, <hi>that the Presidents of all ranks of Synods, Classi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, Diocesan, &amp;c.</hi> may be used <hi>as Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidents of Councils for concord,</hi> not <hi>as the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 9, 10.</note> pars Imperans, <hi>or constitutive Head of a distinct Church species:</hi> and then comes in his <hi>if,</hi> very opportunely, which no Body would guess did signifie his doubt of it, which he had so industriously proved, nor would any wise man go to draw conclusions, till he were well assured of the premises: and yet that Sentence which the Dean cited has no dependance at all on this <hi>If,</hi> it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing three Sections after it.</p>
               <p>But we will let this pass, as a hasty saying, and take no advantages of it,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:204354:185"/> especially, since, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> says, <hi>the Dean</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Second Def. <hi>p.</hi> 99.</note>
                  <hi>plainly confutes himself, and confesses, that he sayes, the Question is not whether the Arch-bishops should be over the particular Churches, as Successors to the Apostolical and General Overseers of the first Age, in the ordinary continued parts of their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; nor whether Patriarchs, Diocesans, Lay-chancellors, as Officers of the King, exercising Magistracy, be lawful, and yet</hi> (as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> complains) <hi>he</hi> (the Dean) <hi>saith, that I suppose the contrary;</hi> and well he might, not withstanding all this: for his Arch-bishops have no true Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopal Authority over Parish Bishops, but are only <hi>Presidents of Councils for</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Way to concord, p. 110.</note>
                  <hi>concord, not</hi> pars imperans, <hi>or the consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutive Heads of a distinct Church-species;</hi> and his Diocesans are not Church-Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, but the King's Ministers in Church-Affairs; and therefore his evasion lies only in the Equivocal use of the name of Arch-bishops and Diocesan Bishops: and he does expresly assert, in the very same place, in answer to the Dean's false Accusation, that such Bishops as the Dean means, that is, such Diocesan Bishops, as the Church of <hi>England</hi> acknowledges, does overthrow the Church-species of God's making, and is
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:204354:186"/> therefore unlawful. He sayes indeed, that <hi>Arch-bishops, which are over the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Bishops, do not overthrow it,</hi> that is, his President Arch-bishops, who only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side for Concord in the Council of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, but have no governing power and Authority: <hi>But those</hi> (Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, by us called Diocesan Bishops) <hi>that put them all</hi> (the lower, or Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial Bishops, otherwise called <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) down, and govern the carkasses of the mortified particular Churches, as the lowest Bishops of many score or hundred such as themselves;</hi> that is, who take away Episcopal power, from the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of single Congregations, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise Episcopal Authority over them, who are as good men, and as much Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops as themselves: these are the men, who overthrow the Church-species of Christ's Institution, that is, Parochial Churches, by setting Presbyters over them instead of Bishops. So that the Dean charged him with nothing but what he himself expresly owns, that the <hi>English</hi> Diocesan Episcopacy destroyes the Church-species of Christ's Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore is unlawful, and a worse Usurpation than to make or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose new Ceremonies or Liturgies.</p>
               <pb n="281" facs="tcp:204354:186"/>
               <p>The observing this one thing, spoils all the Evasions and Fallacies, which are the great strength and support of his Cause; and it is to no purpose for him to amuse the World any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger with the name of Bishops, Arch-bishops, Metropolitans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when the Dispute is no more but this, whether every Presbyter be a primitive and Apostolical Bishop, the old Pleas for Presbytery or Independency being new furbished up, and recommended with the flattering Title of Parochial Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy; and Presbyterian Classes, and Provincial and National Synods, with their Prolocutors or Presidents, must pass for Arch-bishops; and thus Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesan Episcopacy must be removed to make room for Presbyterian Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy.</p>
               <p>This also is the occasion of that hot Dispute concerning the ancient extent of Bishopricks; that a Bishop had but one single Congregation under his Cure: now, were it possible for Mr. B. to prove this, (which is so contrary to all the Records of Church-history) what Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice would it do him? Why then it is plain, that every Parish Minister is a Bishop. But how does this follow? In the
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:204354:187"/> first Ages of Christianity, a Bishop had no more Souls under his Care and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, than are at this day in some Parishes in <hi>London,</hi> therefore every Parish Minister is a Bishop: but is this a good Argument? Some Generals have had no more Souldiers in their whole Army, than some Colonels now have under their Command, and therefore those Collonels were Generals. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the extent of ancient Bishopricks was, every Bishop had his Presbyters and Deacons under him; and though a Bishop should intrust a Presbyter now with the particular care of as many Souls, as some Bishops had or have in their whole Diocese, this does not make such a Presbyter a Bishop, for he must act still in the Order of a Presbyter, not of a Bishop; the Episcopal Office in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes an Authority over Presbyters, and the inferiour Clergy, as well as over the People: and when this is once acknowledged, we will dispute the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of Bishopricks with them, and try whether inlarging or lessening the bounds of Bishopricks can make a new distinct Species of Church-government. We acknowledge <hi>the retrenchment of Dioceses, by the multiplication of Suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:204354:187"/> Bishops, a thing very reconcileable with the Honour of the Reformation</hi> (as a late civil <hi>Reflexion</hi> on the Dean, who <note place="margin">Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on Dr. <hi>Still.</hi> p. 7.</note> calls himself a <hi>Conformist,</hi> is pleased to term it) but we deny, that the dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of the Episcopal Authority, or bringing a Presbyterian parity into the Church, under the notion of Parochial Episcopacy, is so reconcileable with the Honour of the Reformation; a Notion which that wise Author has learn'd of Mr. B. and either out of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, or inclination to Presbytery, swallows very glibly, and thinks it an admirable Vindication of Mr. B's esteem for Episcopacy, which is such a redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of primitive Episcopacy, as it was of Regal power, to place the Sovereign Authority of Kings, Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, in a Rump Parliament.</p>
               <p>There is one considerable advantage indeed, which the Dean has taken from Mr. B's concession of <hi>Arch-bishops, that</hi>

                  <hi>is, Bishops that have oversight of many Churches with their Pastors, as lawful Successors of the Apostles in the ordinary part of their work,</hi> for the Vindication of our <hi>English</hi> Episcopacy, and argues thus; <hi>That which is only a continuance of the same kind of Churches, which were
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:204354:188"/> in Being in the Apostolical times, is no devising a new Species of Churches, nor hath any thing repugnant to any Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christ: but that is the case, as to our Episcopacy. We intend no quarrel about names: if it be Mr.</hi> B' <hi>s pleasure to call our Bishops Arch-bishops, let him enjoy his own fancy. It already appears from St.</hi> Cyprian, <hi>and might much more be made plain from many others, if it were needful, that the Bishops of several Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es were looked on as Successors to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, in the care and Government of Churches. Now the Office of Mr.</hi> B' s <hi>Parochial Bishops was only to attend to one particular Congregation; but the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical Office was above this, while the Apostles held it in their own hands; and did not make a new Species of Churches, nor overthrow the constitution of Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial Churches. It seems then a strange thing to me, that the continuance of the same kind of Office in the Church, should be called the devising a new Species of Churches:</hi> and that our Bishops, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">

               <pb n="285" facs="tcp:204354:188"/>
               <p>Now here Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is taken, and knows not how to disintangle himself, but makes some faint offers at it. And first, <note place="margin">Second Defence, p. 104.</note> he endeavours to make some advantage from the Dean's <hi>giving him leave to call our Bishops Arch-bishops:</hi> which the Dean we see very civilly did to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent wrangling about words; But now he has leave to call them Arch-bishops, he won't do it, but proves that they are no Arch-bishops, for <hi>Arch-bishops have Churches with their proper Bishops under them; but our Bishops say, that there are no such under them;</hi> i. e. our Bishops can't be Arch-bishops unless every Parochial Minister be a Bishop. Nor does the Dean say, this is a proper name for them: and, as to humour him, he gave him leave to call Bishops Arch-bishops, so if that will please him, he may call Presbyters Bishops too, so he will but own them subject to a Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Apostolical Authority, now resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in Diocesan Bishops or Arch-bishops.</p>
               <p>But he answers, secondly, <hi>I told you before, that as the Major General, Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termaster General,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>of an Army, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituteth not a distinct body from the Army, and the particular Regiments and Troops,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:204354:189"/> so I am not certain, that Apostles or Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists, or any general Preachers, as such, did constitute any Church-Form distinct from the Catholick and the particular Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops Churches: but if they are supposed to have taken their several fixed Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (which I never saw proved) I will not contend whether those Provinces may be called Churches; if we agree about the thing, use the name as you see cause.</hi> This is very surprizing, he dares not deny the Apostolical Authority over Bishops, and was ashamed to deny what he had so lately granted, that the ordinary parts of the Apostolical Authority might still be conveyed to some Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es Officers, to oversee and govern Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors as well as People: and he had no mind now to dispute, whether that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which we ascribe to our Bishops be any other than this Apostolical Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and therefore now all that he has to say, is, <hi>that he is not certain, that Apostles, or Evangelists, or general Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as such,</hi> (but we speak not now of general Preachers, as such, but of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour Governours) <hi>did constitute any Church-Form distinct from the Catholick and the particular Bishops Churches.</hi> Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful! He disputes against Diocesan
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:204354:189"/> Episcopacy, because this is to make a new Form and Species of Churches, of man's devising; the Dean proves, that this is not making, or devising, a new Church-species or Form, but onely the exercise of that Apostolical Authority, which, he allows, may be lawfully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised in the Church, and now he will not allow it to be any Church-Form at all: however, if it be none, we gain thus much by it, that it is not a new one, of man's devising; and therefore not unlawful, but such as they ought to submit to, and we will dispute it no farther.</p>
               <p>And yet it is strange, if Ecclesiastical power and authority is so essential to the nature and Being of a Church, (which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> perpetually insists on, to prove, that we un-church all Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial Churches, by denying them full power of Discipline and Government) that Churches should be formed with respect to an inferiour, and not to the Supreme power of the Church; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks the Argument holds stronger the other way, according to Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s own principles; that, if no Society be a compleat Church, which has not all Ecclesiastical power in it self necessary
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:204354:190"/> to Church-government, then no Church is a compleat and perfect Church which wants Apostolical Authority, which is the highest power in the Church, and can controul any Inferiour degree of Power; and thus his lower Parochial Bishops cannot constitute a complete Church, as not having Apostolical Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; but a Diocesan Church, which has this Authority, is the first complete and perfect Church.</p>
               <p>And it is stranger still, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles should be the first Founders of Churches, and the Supreme Governours of them, and yet the Apostolical Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority not constitute any Church-Form: which is as much as to say, that the Supreme Authority in the Church is no part of its Form or Government, that Kingly power is not essential to the notion of a Kingdom.</p>
               <p>But that which has bewildred Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is, that he cannot find an Apostolical Church distinct from all the particular Churches founded by the Apostles; and I should greatly wonder, if he could: and therefore to unriddle this Mystery to him, and to let him see, how Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical Authority goes to the Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of a Church, I observe, that the
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:204354:190"/> Apostolical Authority did concur to the nature and form of those Churches which were founded by the Apostles, which were not compleat Churches without it.</p>
               <p>Though the Apostles did not always reside in one Church, as fixed Bishops, yet they kept the Supreme power of Government in their own hands: they ordained Elders, who were subject to their command, they gave Rules of Discipline, and gave Orders and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority for executing Church-censures, as they saw occasion; they sent Letters or Evangelists to put their Directions in practise, as is evident from the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and those many Letters he wrote to the several Churches, founded and governed by him; so that the Apostles were the Supreme Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours of the Churches they founded, which is the reason why it is probable, as the Dean observes, <hi>that while the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles lived there were no fix'd Bishops, or very few, for they managed the Affairs of Government themselves: but as they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew, they did, in some Churches sooner, in some later, as their own continuance, the condition of the Churches, and the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi>

                  <hi>of the Persons were, commit the
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:204354:191"/> care and Government of Churches to such Persons whom they appointed thereto.</hi> And Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Exceptions against this are very mean; as first, <hi>that then, while they</hi> (the <note place="margin">Second Def. <hi>p.</hi> 108.</note> Apostles) <hi>lived, there were but twelve or thirteen Bishops in the World, if any: and were there no more Churches in the World that had Governing-Pastors?</hi> Yes, they had all Governing-Pastors, as our Churches now have, besides the Bishops, but the Supreme Governing-power was in their own hand. 2. <hi>Then if it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be proved that the Apostles were fixed Bishops, there were none in the World in their times:</hi> that is not said, that there were none during all the Apostles times; for it is evident, St. <hi>James,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> was a fixed Bishop from the beginning; but they were planted by degrees, as their absence, or the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the Church required. Thus, when St. <hi>Paul</hi> went to <hi>Rome, Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and, it is not improbable, many others, were ordained Bishops, and left behind him: And what if there were no fixed Bishops in those dayes, when this want was supplied by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite diligence of the Apostles, in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling, writing, sending Messengers and Evangelists from one Church to
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:204354:191"/> another, and by those miraculous gifts with which the Christian Churches were enriched in those dayes.</p>
               <p>He seems to prove something, though I know well what, in what follows; <hi>If the Apostles were not fixed Bishops of any single Churches, they have no Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, as such; if they were, we must have but twelve or thirteen Bishops, as their Successors in the World; and which be those Seats, and how prove they their claim?</hi> But did not Mr. <hi>B.</hi> acknowledge, that the ordinary governing power of the Apostles might lawfully be continued in the Church; to what purpose then does this serve, to prove that there must be none, or that they can be but thirteen such Apostolical Arch-bishops? Our Saviour thought twelve or thirteen Apostles sufficient to plant the Christian Church, but more Apostolical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours may be necessary for the Encrease and Government of it, esgecially when those extraordinary Apostolical Gifts ceased, though the ordinary power re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained: and therefore, what inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience there can be to say, that the Apostles appointed particular Bishops their Successors in the care of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches, not as Successors to their
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:204354:192"/> whole Apostolical Office, I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.</p>
               <p>By this time, I hope, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> can tell how the Apostolical authority may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute a Church Form, without finding a Church distinct from the Catholick, or particular Bishops Churches, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding the whole Church into Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Provinces. But, the truth is, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> has granted more than will consist with the Defence of his Cause, in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging such Arch-bishops as are the Apostles Successors in the ordinary parts of Apostolical Authority; for he never designed any more than a President Arch-bishop: but the Dean has unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully taken him at an advantage, and proved that an Apostolical Successor is somewhat more than a President, even such very Creatures as Diocesan Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and he can neither go safely forward, nor make an honourable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat.</p>
               <p>This possibly will be thought a long digression, though it is more to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose than every one may be aware of: for my business was to shew, that the bounds and extents of Bishopricks not being determined by a Divine Law, while the Church is governed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:204354:192"/> to the ancient Form, by Church-governours of Divine or Apostolical Institution, such as Bishops, Priests, and Deacons; a small or larger Diocese, whatever other faults it may have, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make a new Form or Species of Church-government, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> affirms, in contradiction of the sense of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and there was no such effectual way to detect his Fallacies, as by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it appear, that his Quarrel was not so much against the extent of Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, as against the primitive Apostolical Form of Episcopacy it self, though he endeavours to palliate it with an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal Use of the names Bishops, Arch-bishops, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thus, to proceed, the combination of Neighbour Diocesan Churches, for the preservation of Catholick Unity, and the more regular administration of Discipline, by mutual advice and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, into Archiepiscopal, National, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchal Churches, though it be not founded on any express Divine Law, yet is warranted by our obligations to Catholick Unity: For, if there be but one Catholick Church, and one Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Communion, all Churches must live in Communion with each other,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:204354:193"/> and therefore more especially Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Churches, whose very Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood makes them more capable of a mutual discharge of those Christian Offices wherein Christian Communion consists, than those at a greater distance are.</p>
               <p>For this reason, I cannot but won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, when I hear men demand a proof of the Divine Institution of National Churches, which seems to me, as if they should demand a proof of the divine Institution of Catholick Communion: for the common reason of mankind will conclude, that if all Churches are bound to live in Communion with each other, Neighbour Churches ought to unite into as large Bodies, and into as large Bodies, and into as strict Confederacies and Combinations, as will serve and promote the ends of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Communion, and that this is not only lawful, but a necessary duty.</p>
               <p>Thus Mr. <hi>B.</hi> himself distinguishes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>humane terms of Communion,</hi> and <note place="margin">The only way of concord, cap. 10. p. 100, &amp;c.</note>
                  <hi>humane acts,</hi> which are onely <hi>the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiating a known duty,</hi> such <hi>as holding Christian love and concord,</hi> and upon this account dares not wholly reject those Church-Forms, called <hi>Classical, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitical, &amp;c.</hi> though he is not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:204354:193"/> to call them <hi>Church-Forms.</hi> Now if it will be acknowledged, that <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Communion</hi> is a necessary duty, (which, I hope, I have sufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) then the Combination of Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>san Churches into greater Bodies, for the preservation of Catholick Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, is only the circumstantiating a known duty, by <hi>humane acts,</hi> and therefore not only lawful, but, in some sense, necessary, as being only the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of a divine Law to particular Cases.</p>

               <p>IT is time now to apply this Doctrine of <hi>one Catholick Communion,</hi> to the several Forms or distinctions of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and to those particular acts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Communion peculiar to each of them, and I shall confine my self to these three kinds of Churches, (if they may be so called) the particular, or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocesan Church, the National Church, and the Universal Church.</p>
               <pb n="298" facs="tcp:204354:195"/>
               <p>I shall begin with a particular, or Diocesan Church; for I must own, that Parochial Congregations have not the complete essence of a Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they have not full power of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline and Government within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but are parts of the Diocesan Church.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> both agree in this, that local, presential Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is essential to the constitution of a particular Church-state, and they allow no other Church-form to be of divine Institution, but where all the Members of it may enjoy <hi>present Communion:</hi> there is indeed some little difference between Dr. <hi>O.</hi> and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> in stating the Notion of present Communion: <hi>Dr. Owen</hi> is for such a Church, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all the Members may enjoy <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> in all acts of Worship as well as Discipline, which is the true notion of <note place="margin">Enquiry into the Orig. of Churches. ch. 4. p. 60.</note> of a Congregational Church, which is a Church consisting of one worshipping Assembly or Congregation: Mr. <hi>B.</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larges the notion of <hi>presential Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;</hi> and will allow a Church to consist of several worshipping Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, which may by turns commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with one another, and their Head

               <p>I shall begin with a consideration of <hi>Dr. O</hi>'s proofs for the divine Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of such Congregational Churches, wherein all the Members enjoy local, and presential Communion, according to that definition he gives of a Church. And the <hi>Dr.</hi> argues from three general <note place="margin">Enquiry into the Orig. of Churches. p. 60.</note> Topicks, which, I confess, are of that weight and moment, that if any one of them hold good, I will yield the Cause. 1.

From the nature of <hi>congregational Churches, which alone are suited unto the ends of Christ, in the Institution of his Church,</hi> ch. 6. The first and third, as the Dr. has managed them, seem very coincident, but where they are capable of a distinct considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they shall have it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let us consider how he proves Congregational Churches to be of Christ's appointment and Institution, and he uses three Arguments to this purpose.</p>

For thus he argues; <hi>Christ appointed that Church-state which is meet and accommodated unto all the ends which he designed in his Institution of a Church; but such a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is that Church, Form, and Order</hi>

For the preservation of the Doctrine of the Gospel, in it's Purity and Obedience unto the Commands of Christ in it's Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity: 2. To preserve Love entire among his Disciples: 3. That it might be a due Representation of his own Love, Care, Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, Patience, Meekness, in the acting of his Authority in the Church. 4. To be an Evidence and Pledge of the future Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> And he adds, <hi>It is in Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Churches alone, that these things
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:204354:197"/> can be done and observed; for unto all of them are required Assemblies of the whole Church.</hi> This is the whole Strength of his Argument, to prove that Christ has instituted Congregational Churches. To which I answer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That I do not much like the way of arguing, for, 1. it seems a little too bold and peremptory, to determine what Christ must do, for, whatever his ends were in the Institution of a Church, we cannot say; but the eternal Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Father had more ways than one to accomplish those ends: and I would not undertake to prescribe what infinite Wisdom must do, but rather consider what is done.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It gives an endless Scope to every man's Fancy, to model Churches ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their own Humours, and then grow fond of their Dreams, and then think it best at least, that it should be so; and thence conclude, that God who always does what is best, hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, that it shall be so. Thus the Papists conceive it the most effectual way to preserve the Unity of the Church, the Purity of Doctrine, the Exercise of Discipline, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that there should be one supreme infallible Head
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:204354:197"/> and Monarch of the Church; and thence confidently conclude, that Christ has ordained such a Head, and that the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> is the man. This is a way of arguing, that any men may make use of, and though possibly all men may not argue with the same Appearance of Reason, to equal Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, yet there are so many specious things to be said on all sides, in this way, that every man will be left to judge according to his own Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which is never likely to end a Controversie.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our Saviour in his own Person instituted no particular Form of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es at all, but only sent forth his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles to convert men to the Faith, and to form them into a Church-Society; so that we cannot plead the immediate Institution or Appointment of Christ one way or other, unless we can spell out any particular Church-form in that general Commission, which Christ gave to his Apostles, and I doubt that will not look very like a Congregational Church.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Dr. <hi>O.</hi> fails in enumerating the ends for which Christ instituted his Church, for he has left out the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:204354:198"/> end of all, which was, <hi>to unite all Believers in one Body to Christ, their Head.</hi> The great Mystery of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity consists in our Union to Christ, whereby we are made partakers of all the Benefits and Blessings which he hath purchased by his Sufferings and Death: now our Union to Christ is by our Incorporation into his <hi>Church,</hi> which is his <hi>Body,</hi> and <hi>Spouse,</hi> which he purchas'd by his own Blood, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns by his Spirit, and will finally bring to Glory: to be a visible Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of this Church, is necessary to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title us to the external Communion and Priviledges of it; and our Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, that all his true and sincere Disciples, should be united in external and visible Communion, which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will excuse them from, while it may be lawfully had; so that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church is founded upon that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, which Christ purchased with his Blood, and administers by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his Intercession; and the Reason of instituting this Church, is to give us an Interest in the Merits and Interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of our Saviour, which none can have any Interest in, but those who are Members of his Body, that is, of his
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:204354:198"/> Church; and therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes the Union between Christ and his Church, to be a very great Mystery, like being made Flesh of his Flesh, and <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 30. 32.</note> Bone of his Bone. The nature and Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Church does not consist in religious Assemblies, but in it's Union to Christ, as Head of the body; all the acts of Christian Worship, and holding Assemblies for religious Worship, is a necessary Church-duty, wherein our visible Communion with Christ con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists; but it is a Covenant-relation to Christ, which constitutes the Church, and therefore it is unreasonable to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a Church-form, merely from the Consideration of worshipping Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, which are a necessary duty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of Church-Society, but are conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to the Constitution of a Church, and do not include the whole nature of it: as to give some plain Instances of this, whereby every one may better understand what I mean.</p>
               <p>This Church which is united to Christ, by a Covenant-relation, is but <hi>one Body;</hi> for Christ has but one Body and one Spouse, as I have already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at large, and therefore, particular Churches must be formed not only with
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:204354:199"/> respect to the conveniency of religious Assemblies, but to Catholick Unity, which is a plain demonstration, that the nature of particular Churches can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be confined to Independent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, which are distinct, intire, complete Churches in themselves, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any relation to other Churches, but what is owing to voluntary Compacts and Confederations, which any Church may refuse, that pleases; much less can it be thought destructive to the Being of a Church, to be larger than a single Congregation, when the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church is but one Body and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</p>
               <p>Thus if the Church be united to Christ, by a Convenant-relation, and this Union to Christ makes it a Church, then the nature of a Church does not consist in a Church-Covenant between such a particular Pastor and People, and of one Member with another. If Christ be our Head, the great Bishop and Shepheard of Souls, all Church Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity must be derived from him, and the relation of People to their Pastors, must be founded on that Authority they receive from Christ: for none can give Power, but he who has it; none
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:204354:199"/> can be a Christian who does not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Authority of Christ, and therefore this Authority is antecedent to the forming of a Church, and not a consequent act of the Church it self; for nothing can be more wild than to think, that the authority of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment resides in those who are to be governed; when the Society does not depend upon any Humane acts and compacts, but on a divine Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and therefore requires a Divine authority to admit men into this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant: Thus we know Christ or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained his Apostles, committed to them the power of the Keys, and gave them authority to preach the Gospel, and to incorporate all Believers into the Church by Baptism, in order to the forming of Church-Society; and that distinction Dr. <hi>O.</hi> makes between <hi>extraordinary Officers</hi> (such as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles) <note place="margin">Orig. of Churches, p. 40.</note>
                  <hi>whose Office and Power is antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to the Church, and those ordinary Officers, unto whose Office and Power the Church essentially considered is ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent,</hi> is a mere evasion, to render a successive communication of Power from Christ to Church-Officers, need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, and to invest the People with a
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:204354:200"/> power of choosing and ordaining their own Pastors.</p>
               <p>The extraordinary Officers, he sayes, ceased with the Apostles, and <hi>nothing is more vain than to pretend any suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid.</hi> P. 41.</note>
                  <hi>unto them, in the whole, or any part of their Office:</hi> If the Apostolical Office, in every part of it, ceased with the Apostles, how does Christ make good his promise to them, <hi>Lo, I am with you alway, even to the end of the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 20.</note>
                  <hi>world?</hi> Which must refer, not to the Persons of the Apostles, who were to live but a little while, but to them and their Successors in their Office and Ministry, which was to continue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, if Christ promised to be alway with them.</p>
               <p>But what was that Apostolical Office which is now ceased? He will not sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call extraordinary Gifts and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Powers, and divine Inspiration, the Apostolical Office; for in that Age of Miracles all this was common to others besides the Apostles, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the Church after their decease. Nor is an immediate Commission from Christ an extraordinary Office, but only an extraordinary way of convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Office and Power; and as for
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:204354:200"/> the <hi>extent of their Commission, giving them power towards all the world for their conversion, and over all Churches for their edification,</hi> I do not see but that every Gospel Bishop or Pastor has as extensive a Commission; for we are Ministers of the Catholick Church, though the exercise of our Ministry be more peculiarly confined to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain place, for the better edification of that Church: and we have the same Authority, though not the same Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, because not the same Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, to preach the Gospel to <hi>Jews, Turks,</hi> and <hi>Heathens,</hi> whom we may still convert to Christianity, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive into the Church, as we have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to do it: Those indeed who have no other authority but what they receive from the choice of a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Congregation, are not Ministers of the Catholick Church, but those who receive their authority by a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession from the Apostles are; for they are the Ministers of any particular Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So that nothing extraordinary in the Apostles was the Apostolical Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and Power, but only an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary manner of discharging this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:204354:201"/> suitable to their extraordinary Endowments, and necessary to the first forming of a church: but to preach the Gospel, to baptise those who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, to consecrate the Eucharist, to govern the Church; in a word, the power of the Keys, to receive in, and to shut out of the Church, is the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical Office and Power which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Bishop enjoyes in as ample manner as the Apostles did; and therefore were alway in the primitive Church acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for the Apostles Successors; and to say that this state is ceased, is, in effect, to say, the Church it self is failed; for, as for Dr. <hi>Owen</hi>'s ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <hi>Officers,</hi> who derive not their Power from Christ and his Apostles: but from the Church, that is the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of private Christians, who take them for their Pastors, they are none of Christ's Officers, nor have Legal Right to Church-authority.</p>
               <p>Two things he urges to prove that the Church does not fail, though the Apostolical Office is ceased; First, <hi>That the Offices themselves were of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of Christ:</hi> But what Offices are those? It is evident, that Christ, after his Resurrection, gave commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:204354:201"/> to none but his Apostles to preach the Gospel, this was the onely Office he instituted himself, and if this be failed, he has instituted no other. Yes, the Apostle sayes, that <hi>Christ gave some</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 11. 12.</note>
                  <hi>Apostles, and some Prophets, and some Evangelists, and some Pastors and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</hi> But how did Christ do this, but by such extraordinary Gifts as quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied them for such Ministeries in the Church, for the exercise of which, they received Rules and Power from the Apostles, who had the Supreme Government of the Church? these were certainly as much <hi>extraordinary Officers</hi> as the Apostles, and therefore may, with the same reason, be presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to cease, when extraordinary Gifts ceased, as the Apostolical Office did, if we may take his word for it.</p>
               <p>But, not to dispute about the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of Offices, let us consider who appoints these Officers, and for that he tells us, 2. <hi>That Persons were</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 42.</note>
                  <hi>to be interested in these Offices, by the way and means by him prescribed:</hi> (so far we agree, for no man can have any authority conveyed to him, but in such wayes as Christ appoints) <hi>which were not such as depended on his own imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:204354:202"/> extraordinary actings, as it was with the former sort</hi> (this we also grant, if, by <hi>extraordinary actings</hi> he means an immediate Commission, or miraculous Gifts) <hi>but such as consisted in the Churches acting according to his Law, and in obedience to his Commands.</hi> This is so generally expressed, that we must learn his meaning what this Law is, from what he declares a little after: <hi>For none can communicate this Power</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 57.</note>
                  <hi>to others, but those who have received it themselves from Christ. Now this is the whole Church, and not any Person in it, or Prelate over it: look whatever constitutes it a Church, that gives it all the Power and Priviledges of a Church; for a Church is nothing but a Society of profess'd Believers, enjoying all Church-Power and Priviledges, by vertue of the Law of Christ. Ʋnto this Church, which is his Spouse, doth the Lord Christ com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Keys of his House, by whom they are delivered into the hands of his Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, so far as their Office requires that trust.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How much easier is it to make fine Hypotheses, than it is to prove them? Dr. <hi>O.</hi> knows it will not be easily grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without a Proof, that the whole
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:204354:202"/> Church, and not any Person or Prelate in it, (he should have added Apostle too) has received the Power of ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Officers from Christ; and yet here is no other proof assigned, but only a definition of a Church of his own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, that it is such a Society, as has this Power, which was the thing to be proved. St. <hi>Paul</hi> only tells us, that <note place="margin">4 Eph. 11, 12.</note> Christ gave Apostles and Prophets, and other Officers to the Church, to instruct and govern it, not that he gave the Church power to make such Officers. Has Christ given away the Keys to his Spouse, that is, his own Power and Authority? I am sure St. <hi>Paul</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents the Church a little otherwise, not <note place="margin">5 Eph. 23, 24.</note> as a governing, but an obedient Wife. But our Saviour gave the Keys to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and to the rest of the Apostles, and it does not appear, when he took them away again, and gave them to his Spouse: I am sure the Apostles kept them all the time they lived; and if there be any credit to be given to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Records, delivered them to their Successors; and thus they have been handed down to our days. And we never heard, till of late, that the Church laid any Claim to the Keys, any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:204354:203"/> than as in the hands of their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; for indeed, the Keys is the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical or Episcopal Office, and to give the Keys to the Church, is to make them all Bishops, and to leave none to be governed; and yet it was never heard yet, that any could give the Keys but those who had them.</p>
               <p>But, suppose Christ has committed the Keys to his Church, it is worth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring, what this Church is, to whom the Keys are committed; if by this Church he means Pastor and People, we grant the Church has the Keys, but in their Pastors hands; if only a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Believers, about to form them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into a Church-Society, I would fain know, where such a company of men are called a Church, or have Right to any Church-priviledges: for what he means by his <hi>essential Church,</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell, since it is evident, there is no Church-Society without Church-Officers, nor any Church-power, where there is no Church. Let Church-Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers be ordinary or extraordinary, (I mean such Officers as are essential to the Constitution of a Church) it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that in order of Nature, they are before the Church; for no man can be
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:204354:203"/> admitted into the Church, but by a legal Officer, and therefore, though of necessity those Bishopes and Pastors which are ordained after the Church is formed, must be in order of time, after the Being of the Church, yet the Office is before the Church, and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to the continuance of it; which is a plain Proof, that the Church, if by that we mean the body of Christian People, cannot give the Keys, though it may consent in the person to receive them, because Church-power is always antecedent to the Being of a Church.</p>
               <p>Had Dr. <hi>O.</hi> sufficiently considered these things, he would not have scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed so prophanely at the Conveyance of Church-power by successive Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from the Apostles, without which, I confess I know not how we should have any Church-power, himself ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowledging, that it is to be had only in the way of Christ's Appointment, and he is able to shew no other way, that Christ has appointed, or the Church practised, but only this: for whatever Interest the People had in the choice of Church-officers, it was not the Peoples consent, but the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops Ordination, that made them so;
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:204354:204"/> and I would desire him, as he values the honour of Religion, not to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to overthrow successive Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by such sceptical Arguments, as will shake Christianity it self; and as he values the Honour of our common Lord and Saviour, not to burlesque his Institutions, which is the sum of all his Arguments against Succession; at least, if he will, grant that Christ might probably foresee, that there would be bad men at one time or other in the Succession.</p>
               <p>The Sum is this, that the Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the nature of the Church, which consists in an Union to Christ by a Covenant-relation, which unites all Christians into one Body, and is formed by Christ's Authority, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines the very Foundations of Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant Congregations; for it is hence evident, that a Church-Society may be larger than a worshipping Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, since all Christians are united to Christ in one Body, and the Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Church does not depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a voluntary Church-Covenant, for local and presential Communion, nor an inherent Authority in the People, to ordain their own Pastors, with
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:204354:204"/> whom they will live in personal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
               <p>But fourthly, Let us, out of civility, grant Dr. <hi>O.</hi> his own way of reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and try what advantage he can make of it: He tells us, that all the ends of Church-Society can be <hi>observed only in Congregational Churches,</hi> because <hi>unto all of them there are required As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies of the whole Church:</hi> now <hi>these ends for which the Lord Christ ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed this Church-state, he reduces to three general Heads.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, <hi>The professed subjection of the Souls and Consciences of Believers unto his Authority, in the observance of his Commands, which,</hi> he sayes, <hi>cannot be done in any Church-state imaginable, wherein the Members of the Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not meet together for this end, which they can onely do in such a Church as is congregational.</hi> And he gives these instances of this professed subjection to Christ: The first, our Baptismal Profession; for so he cites <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 18, 19, 20. which refers onely to the Institution of Baptism; now I would desire Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> to tell me, whether Baptism be not valid, unless it be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred in the presence of the whole
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:204354:205"/> Church, and what then he thinks of private Baptisms, which are now so generally practised, even among those of the Congregational way? or how he can prove that Baptism was alwayes administred in the presence of the whole Church? or, whether Baptism, administred in a Parochial Church, in as frequent an Assembly as a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational Church, may not be supposed as publick a profession of Faith, as that which is made in a Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Church? His second Instance is, that professed subjection to the Gospel, which the <hi>Corinthians</hi> made by their liberal Contributions for the supply of the necessities of other Churches; for so he alledges, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 13. Now, I suppose, this might have been done, whatever Church-state they had been in: for, I hope Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> will not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to prove, that a Diocesan Church cannot send liberal Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the supply of Foreign Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and thereby profess their subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Gospel; and yet, if this were well sifted, it would prove no great argument for Independent Churches: for this Contribution to the Saints of other Churches, was founded upon
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:204354:205"/> this Principle, that they were but one Body, and one Church, and that they are Members one of another, by a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Institution, which is not consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with the notion of Independent Congregations. His third instance is, of that publick profession of Christ, which we are required to make before men, <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Heathens,</hi> who perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Religion and Disciples of Christ; for which he alledges <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 33. But surely this Profession of Christ may be made by men of any Church-state; for it is not to be made before the Church, but before Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, as we may see <hi>Mark</hi> 8. 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38. which, I suppose, is the other place intended by him, though the Printer has mistaken <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> for <hi>Mark.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Another <hi>end</hi> (he assigns) <hi>of the Evangelical Church-state, is, the joynt celebration of all Gospel-Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and worship.</hi> Now we will grant him, that Assemblies for publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is a necessary Church-duty, but how does it appear, that it is essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to a Church-state, that all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a Church should meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:204354:206"/> in the same place for acts of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; that it has sometimes been so, when the Members of a Church have been no more than could meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one Congregation, we grant; but, that it alwayes was so, and that it is essential to the notion of a Church, we deny, and do not see how he has proved it: the Catholick Church is more properly a Church than any sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Congregation, and yet cannot wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship God all in one place; a consent in the same Worship does more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually unite the Worshippers than the same place. <hi>The exercise of the Gifts and Graces of the Spirit of God, and the mutual edification of the Disciples,</hi> which are two reasons he assigns for this, equally extend to the whole Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church; and, if this cannot be done in Worshipping-Assemblies, unless the whole Church assemble to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the Catholick Church can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver exercise its Gifts and Graces, nor edifie its Members. And his two other Reasons, if I understand the force of them, quite overthrow his Notion: As,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>That he</hi> (Christ) <hi>might hereby testifie his promised presence with
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:204354:206"/> his Disciples unto the end of the World: for it is in Church-Assemblies, in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of his holy worship, that he is present with his Disciples:</hi> and proves this from <hi>Matthew</hi> 28. 20. from Christ's promise to be with his Apostles in the discharge of their Apostolical Office, which is nothing to his purpose, for their Office was not confined to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Assemblies: and from <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 13. where Christ is said to be in the midst of the golden Candlesticks, that is, the seven Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> which he ought first to have proved Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational Churches, and that he is never in the midst of them, but at the time of their Religious Assemblies, before it will prove what he intends; and yet his conclusion is as weak as his proofs, and indeed recoils upon himself: for Christ is certainly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent with the Catholick Church, and all the Religious Assemblies in it, even with two or three gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, in his name, and therefore there is no need to confine a Church-state to a single Congregation, to engage the presence of Christ with them.</p>
               <pb n="322" facs="tcp:204354:207"/>
               <p>Fourthly, He adds, <hi>In these Churches thus exercised in the holy Worship of God, he gives us a resemblance and representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the great Assembly above, who worship God continually before his Throne.</hi> But, methinks, this is better done by the Worship of the whole Catholick Church, though divided into nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous worshipping Assemblies, than by one single Congregation, call it a Church, or what you please: I am sure Learned men conceive that Vision of the Throne of God, incircled by four and twenty Elders, in St. <hi>John's Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> to be a proper representation of the Catholick Church. <note place="margin">4 Revel. 3, 4, 5: <hi>Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyke</hi>'s Right of the Church. p. 93. 94. Orig. of Churches. p. 64.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But he proves, that <hi>Assemblies of the whole Church, at once and in one place for the Celebration of divine Worship is of the Essence of a Church, without which, it hath no real Being, because, that when God instituted such a Church-Form, as wherein all the Members of it could not ordinarily come together every Week, for this end; yet he ordained, that for the preservation of their Church-state, three times in a Year, the Males, (which was the circumcised Church) should appear together in one place, to celebrate the most
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:204354:207"/> solemn Ordinances of his Worship.</hi> This I confess, is very surprizing, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what new: but I have several things to reply.</p>
               <p>First, this necessarily unchurches the Catholick Church, which I am not willing to do, till I see a fair Answer returned to what I have already said in proof of it; and if there be a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, the same Difficulties which hindred present and personal Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church, <hi>from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Limits of that Church to a whole Nation,</hi> are so far from being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by the Gospel-state, that they are as much greater, as the whole World is larger than <hi>Jury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Methinks it is a little odd, for the Dr. to argue from an occasional, personal Communion, three times in a year, to prove the necessity of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, personal Communion, when one did not infer the other at that very time, when it was made necessary by a Divine Law, but did suppose there was no need of constant personal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, to the Being of a Church, by appointing such general Assemblies but three times a year; and I know Dr. <hi>O.</hi>
                  <pb n="324" facs="tcp:204354:208"/> does not like that Argument from oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casional to constant Communion in other cases.</p>
               <p n="3">3. How does it appear, that these general Assemblies at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> three times a year, were instituted by God, <hi>for the Preservation of their Church-State,</hi> that they could not continue a Church without it? There is no such reason assigned for the Institution of these Feasts, but quite other Reasons assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for them; and if they continued a Church all the year besides without this personal Communion, it is strange, that in the nature of the thing, Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Communion should be so essential to the Being of a Church, that they could not continue a Church without it three times a year.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That these Feasts were not insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted for the preservation of their Church-state, is evident from this, that no Women were obliged to travel to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> at these solemn Feasts; and therefore, if personal Communion be necessary to preserve a Church-state, they must of necessity forfeit their Church-state, if ever they had it; for, I find that is some doubt, from what
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:204354:208"/> the Dr. adds in a Parenthesis, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Males, that they were <hi>the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised Church;</hi> they indeed only were circumcised: but did Women be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Church, or not? If they did, as I believe he will hardly deny, then the whole Church did never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy personal Communion, or Women must forfeit their Church-state, and I hope he will not be so unkind to that Sex, who are none of the worst Friends to Congregational Churches.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I add farther, that even at these solemn Feasts, the whole body of <hi>Israel</hi> could not worship God <hi>at once, and in one place,</hi> as we may easily guess, if we consider their vast numbers, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundred thousand fighting men there were in the days of King <hi>David,</hi> and no Temple was capacious enough for the receiving of them at once, nor did the nature of these Feasts require it; for the Passover was eaten in private Houses, though offered at the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and their first Fruits and Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons might be offered to God without the presence of the whole Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and they might worship at the Temple, or in their Synagogues, by
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:204354:209"/> Turns, and so may the largest Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>san Church, and so they do, worship God, and hold Communion with one another, in distinct Assemblies, under the same Rule and Government.</p>
               <p>For, 6. The reason of their appearing at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> besides the mystical Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of those Feasts, was peculiar to that Dispensation, that being the place which God had chose to place his name there; and therefore it is called <hi>appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before the Lord;</hi> and when Dr. <hi>O.</hi> can shew us a place of such peculiar Sanctity and Holiness, where God dwells in so peculiar a manner, let our Church-state be what it will, I shall think all Christians bound to resort thither, as Occasion and Opportunity will permit.</p>
               <p>Thus I think the Dr. has failed in proving the necessity of <hi>the Assembly of the whole Church at once, and in one place, for the Celebration of the divine Worship,</hi> from the Example of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church, and so has furnished us with the Example of a Church, divinely instituted to overthrow the necessity of local and personal Communion, to the Being of a Church; for, the <hi>Jewish</hi>
                  <pb n="327" facs="tcp:204354:209"/> Church had no such Communion, and yet was but one Church, instituted by God himself.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The third end of the Institution of the Gospel Church-state, is the Exercise</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ib. p. 64.</note>
                  <hi>and Preservation of Discipline.</hi> Now Discipline is an act of Government, and I cannot conceive any imaginable Reason, why Government may not be extended to a much larger Society, than can meet together for Acts of Worship. It is evident to the very Sense and daily observation of all men, that one Prince, with his inferiour Ministers, may govern a whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that very prudently and just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and though Ecclesiastical Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline be of a different kind from civil Government, as much as the Keys dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from the Sword, yet I could never learn, what was so peculiar to Church-Government from Civil Government, as should confine the exercise of it to a single Congregation.</p>
               <p>He 1. places Discipline in <hi>the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Gospel in it's Purity, and Obedience unto the Commands of Christ in it's Integrity.</hi> Now, why may not a Bishop with a hundred fixed Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:204354:210"/> take as good Inspection, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister Discipline as prudently to a Church consisting of a hundred Parish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, as one Pastor can to a single Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation? Why may not every Parish-Minister, who acts under the Care and Government of his Bishop, be as dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in instructing his People, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an account of their Faith and Manners, as if he were an absolute In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent Pastor of that Church? Is it not more likely to preserve the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Faith, when every Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter must give an account of his Faith and Doctrine to his Bishop, than when he is an Independent Pastor, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to no body but his Church, that is, his People, whom he is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct, who are more easily imposed on, than grave and learned Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The second end of it</hi> (Discipline) <note place="margin">p. 66.</note>
                  <hi>is to preserve Love intire among his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples:</hi> But now I have already shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that Christian Love, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Christ, consists in Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Communion, and cannot subsist with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, which proves the necessity of Catholick Communion in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:204354:210"/> Church, but is no good Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove the confinement of Communion to an Independent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, which makes a distinct Church by it self.</p>
               <p>As for what he objects, that, <hi>for the most part, those who pretend highly to the preservation of Love, by their coming to the same Church, who dwell in the same Parish, have not so much as the carkass, nay, not the shadow of it.</hi> I wish it be not too often true among the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational Brethren, as it is among those Christians, who worship at the same Parish Church; though we see in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that Faction is oftener apt to endear men than common Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: but the Question is not, what is, but what ought to be, and what may be, and which is the most effectual way to promote it? Does not this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of loving one another extend to all Christians, and therefore as well to Neighbour-Christians, as to those of confederate Churches? Ought we not <hi>to express this Love by a due and constant discharge of mutual Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Admonition, Prayer, and watchful care one of another.</hi> If Congregational
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:204354:211"/> Churches confine this Care to their own Members, they stint and extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish this Spirit of Christian Charity, which is no longer Christian Charity than it extends to all Christians; if they do not, then this Christian Love may, at least, be as well discharged in larger Churches, as in worshipping-Assemblies, or single Congregations.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The third end of it is, that it might be a due representation of his own Love, Care,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in the acting of his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the Church.</hi> But this refers to the manner of exercising Discipline, which requires onely wise and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and truly Christian Governours, and then may be exercised with great kindness, tenderness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> under any Church-state, which will admit of the exercise of Discipline at all: though, methinks, the larger and more diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive this Care is, the more it resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles the Care of our Lord, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to the whole Church, and is not confined to the narrow limits of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Congregation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>It is in part appointed to be an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and pledge of the future Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein the whole Church shall be
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:204354:211"/> judged before the Throne of Christ Jesus.</hi> Now this, I think, overthrows his whole cause, as evidently proving, that true Christian Discipline, according to its original Institution, cannot be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in Independent Congregations; for the power of the Keys consists in receiving in, and shutting out of the Church; and when it is exercised ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Laws of our Saviour, he has promised to confirm and ratifie such Censures, <hi>Whatsoever ye bind on Earth shall be bound in Heaven, and whatsoever ye loose on Earth shall be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in Heaven.</hi> And, upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, <hi>Tertullian</hi> calls Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>futuri Judicii praejudicium,</hi> not <hi>a representation of the future Judgment,</hi> as <note place="margin">p. 67.</note> Dr. <hi>O.</hi> translates it, but a prejudging the Cause, a previous Sentence, which will be ratified and confirmed at the last Judgment.</p>
               <p>But now Congregational Churches may cast an offending Member out of their particular Independent Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, but cannot cast him out of the Communion of the whole Church; for, as they are unaccountable in cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out their Members, so other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:204354:212"/> Churches are as unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in taking them in again, and thus it is only shifting Churches, leaving the Communion of one Church, and being admitted into another, which is nothing like the future Judgment, which finally shuts men out of the Kingdom of Heaven, (which answers to the Christian Church on Earth) and leaves no back door to enter in at: but when there is but one Catholick Communion, and no possibility for him, who is deservedly cast out of the Church, to be received in again, till, by his Repentance and Reformation, he has given satisfaction to the Church which cast him out; this makes Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication truly formidable, and a kind of anticipation of the future Judgment; for he, who is cast out of the Church, is cast out of the visible state of Salvation, and, if the Church do not mistake in her Judgment, is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally lost without reconciliation to God and his Church.</p>
               <p>Having thus particularly examined all his Reasons to prove the necessity of Congregational Churches, from the ends for which Christ instituted Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:204354:212"/> I need not trouble my Readers with considering what follows, which can have no force, if his former Reasons are not good, and what seems most po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular, will fall under consideration in a fitter place.</p>
               <p>His second Argument to prove par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Congregations to be the only Churches of Christ's Institution, is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from <hi>the notation of the word, which</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ib. p. 70.</note>
                  <hi>determines the sense of it to a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Congregation;</hi> for so <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies, according to the use of the Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuagint, <hi>to congregate in a Church-As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly; and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> signifies nothing but a Congregation, which assembles for the Ends and Ʋses of it, and acts its Duties and Powers; and so it signifies in the New Testament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now, methinks, he playes at a low game, when he founds Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Churches on a Grammatical Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticism; and yet it is very ominous, that he stumbles at the Threshold; for he acknowledges that this word <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesia,</hi> which signifies a Congregation, and, as he sayes, can signifie nothing else, <hi>may be sometimes applied unto that, where Essence is not denoted thereby, as
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:204354:213"/> the Church Catholick invisible, which is only a mystical Society or Congregation:</hi> the meaning of which is, that though the Greek word, which we translate a Church, signifies a Congregation, and can signifie nothing else, yet, when it is applied to denote the Catholick Church, it does not signifie a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, because the essence of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church does not consist in a single Assembly or Congregation, as one would easily guess. But now, may not any man that will, argue the other way? that since this word signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies such a Church as is not a single Congregation, therefore we cannot ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue from the notation of the word, that whatever Society, for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of Religion, is called <hi>Ecclesia,</hi> must be a Congregational Church; for when any word is differently applied, we must learn in what sense it is used at any time, from some other marks than the bare notation of the word.</p>
               <p>And so it must be in this case, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially considering that the Catholick Church is most properly called <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi> for this is that Church, which is the Body and the Spouse of Christ,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:204354:213"/> and all particular Churches are called Churches only as they are Members of the Catholick Church, and therefore must be called Churches in the same Sense, that the Catholick Church is a Church, and therefore not considered, as particular Congregations.</p>
               <p>But he thinks to avoid this, by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that <hi>the Catholick Church is invisible,</hi> but let it be visible or invisible, is it truly and properly <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, (whether you translate that Church or Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation) or not? if it be not, then there is no such thing in a proper Sense, as the Catholick Church, and so we have lost one Article of our Creed; if the Catholick Church be properly a Church, of which the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches are Members, then particular Churches are of the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with the Catholick Church, and so not necessarily confined to a single Congregation; but he says, <hi>The Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church is a mystical Society or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,</hi> and are not particular Churches mystical Societies too? Are not they mystically united to Christ, as much as the Catholick Church? This then can make no difference. If there
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:204354:214"/> be any Church of divine Institution, which is not confined to a single Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, then a Church, as a Church is not Congregational.</p>
               <p>But he says, <hi>Wherever it is used to denote an outward visible Society, it doth connote their Assemblies together in one.</hi> Usually I will grant it does so, for Church-Assemblies are essential to a Church-State; but that is not the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, whether a Church must have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Assemblies? but whether a Church must be no larger than one Assembly? And this the Notation of the Word will not prove, for that may be called a Church or Congregation for religious Worship, which is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted under one Rule and Discipline, though all the Members of it do not worship God <hi>at once, in one place:</hi> for thus the Catholick Church is a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping Congregation, tho it meets by parts; for that the Catholick Church is a mere invisible, notional Society, I think I have sufficiently confuted alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and shall consider more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>And yet if I had a mind to play the Critick too, I very much question,
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:204354:214"/> whether the Church in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament be called <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="340" facs="tcp:204354:216"/> to Dr. <hi>O</hi>'s Acceptation of the Church, for a single Congregation, our Saviour has made no Provision to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the Scandals which shall arise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two Persons, who are Members of distinct Congregational Churches, for they cannot judge the Members of another Congregation, as according to the Independent Principles they cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly cannot: and yet methinks it is as necessary to remove the Scandals which happen between persons of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Congregations, as between those of the same, and was certainly intended by Christ in that Rule, <hi>tell it to the Church;</hi> if he intended by this, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve Peace and Unity among Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; which plainly shews, that by the Church here he means a larger Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than a single Congregation, which is not sufficient to remove Scandals and Offences among neighbour Christians, who may dwell very near together, and yet be of distinct Churches.</p>

               <p n="6">6. <hi>One end of this direction is, that the offending and offended Parties may continue together in the communion of the same Church in love, without dissimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> and therefore this Church must be larger than the bounds of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Congregation; unless he can secure us, that no Christians shall ever quarrel but those of the same Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</p>

<pb n="342" facs="tcp:204354:217"/> to decide Church-Controversies; which yet, I think, is somewhat better than an Ecclesiastical Democracy: at least, it is more like the Government of the Jewish Synagogues, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined lesser Causes in subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their <hi>Sanhedrim;</hi> not by the Votes of the People, but by the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Court, to which possibly our Saviour might have some respect, if we will allow him to speak the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of those times, so as to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by those who heard him.</p>
               <p>Nor, lastly, <hi>is it a Presbytery, or the Association of the Elders of many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Congregations, that is intended; for the power claimed in such associated Presbyteries, is, with respect to what is already in or before particular Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which they have not wisdom or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as is supposed, finally to order and determine. But this supposeth, that the Address in the first place be made unto a particular Congregation, which is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore firstly, and properly here intended.</hi> If by Presbyteries he means primitive Presbyteries of the Apostles and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or the Bishop and Presbyters, who determined matters of difference
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:204354:217"/> in the presence of the People, it is most likely this was meant by our Saviour in that Command, <hi>Tell it to the Church.</hi> For the Apostolical Practise is the best Exposition of our Saviour's words, and that this cannot be confined to particular Congregations, I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proved from his own Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and yet why there may not be a more general Tribunal, which has a more extensive Jurisdiction, without which many Controversies among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians cannot be determined, I see not how he proves: for if we must pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve Catholick Communion among Christians of distinct, particular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions, a larger Power and Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is necessary to this end, than the inherent Authority of a particular Church, not onely Congregational but Diocesan.</p>
               <p>This is all I need take notice of with reference to this Argument; Several other things he sayes, which seem to me very weak and unconcluding, and unworthy of Dr. <hi>O.</hi> had he a good Cause to manage, but I pass them over, as not necessary to our present Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie.</p>
               <pb n="344" facs="tcp:204354:218"/>
               <p>His third Argument to prove Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational Churches instituted by <note place="margin">Orig. of Churches, p. 78.</note> Christ, is, <hi>from the nature of the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es instituted by the Apostles, and their ends, as it is expressed in the Scripture:</hi> this he sayes but very little of, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I shall joyn it with his second ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Argument for Congregational Churches, from <hi>the state of the first</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 82.</note>
                  <hi>Churches after the Apostles to the end of the second Century.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And all the difficulty I can see in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering that Historical Account which he hath given us of the primitive Churches, is, in stating the Question right, which he has with great Art la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to perplex and confound.</p>
               <p>The thing to be proved is, that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational Churches are the onely Churches of Divine Institution. To prove this, he must shew, that, <hi>de facto,</hi> such Churches alone were instituted by the Apostles, and owned in the purest Ages of the Church: And to do this plainly, he ought distinctly to consider the several parts of a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational Constitution, as it is opposed to the Diocesan Constitution of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> for otherwise he
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:204354:218"/> can neither serve his own Cause, nor injure ours, and so there are three things to be distinctly considered: 1. The Offices and Officers of the Church. 2. The bounds and extent of the Church, whether it were confined to one or more Congregations, or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping Assemblies. 3. The Power of the People in the Government of the Church. He has given some hints and insinuations of all these, as he goes along, but has never duely stated ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And therefore I shall reduce his Historical Account of this matter to these three Heads, consider how he states these Questions, and how perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent his Testimonies are to prove what he intends, which, I think, every one will acknowledge to be a fair way of proceeding.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As for the first, the Offices and Officers of the Church; the great Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is, Whether Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles instituted a parity or imparity of Officers in the Church? whether Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Presbyters be equal? or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bishops have a Superiour Power, Office, Order, or Degree, call it what you please, over Presbyters. Now this Question he dares not meddle with,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:204354:219"/> during the Apostles times, for, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, the Apostles, while they lived, had a Superiority of Power over other Church-Officers, and governed the Churches which they had planted, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Person, when they were present with them, or by Letters, or by send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Apostles and Evangelists among them, to give directions, and to set things in order which were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss. So that we can have no Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of a parity of Church-Officers all the Scripture-times, during the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical Age: for, though the Elders, Presbyters, Bishops, (for they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently called by these names in Scripture) who were ordained by the Apostles for the Government of the Churches planted by them, did, under the Apostles, govern with equal Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, yet the Apostles themselves were their Bishops, and had a Superiour Power over them, and did censure, depose, and excommunicate them, when occasion required it. Thus St. <hi>John</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ep. 3. 9, 10.</note> threatens to reward <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting those Brethren whom he sent, and neither entertaining them himself, nor suffering others to do it. And thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> excommunicated <hi>Hymenaeus</hi> and <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 20.</note>
                  <pb n="347" facs="tcp:204354:219"/>

               <p>He manages himself with the same Prudence and caution, as to this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in the following History of the Primitive Church; he discovers some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the beginning about the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority of one Church over ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and by what means Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Churches were introduced, which is nothing to this present Business, and has in part been accounted for already, and may be more hereafter; but as for the parity of Officers in the same Church, though he glances at it, as often as he can find any occasion, yet his great business is to fence, and ward off the blow, at which I must acknowledge him to be a great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist.</p>
               <pb n="348" facs="tcp:204354:220"/>
               <p>Thus he acknowledges, that in <hi>Churches which had many Elders, or Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi>

                  <hi>in them, as apparently most of them had, they might, and some of them did, choose out some one endued with especial Gifts, that might in some sort preside amongst them, and who had quickly the name of Bishop appropriated unto him;—But this changed not the state of the Church, though it had no Divine Warrant to authorize it.</hi> But the Question is not about the Presidency in a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Presbyters, of equal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which Antiquity is a great stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to, nor about a distinction of names, which was not presently done, even when the Offices were distinct, but that Superiour Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which Bishops challenged over their Presbyters, such as the Apostles had in their time, and such as <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> gives the Bishop in his time; and though this be no foundation possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly for Metropolitical Churches, yet it is for Diocesan, which is nothing else but a Church under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Bishop, and subject Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters; and such an inequality as this I think would alter the Church-state,
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:204354:220"/> had it first been instituted in a pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Officers; which is like chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging a Commonwealth, governed by a Senate with its President, into a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy.</p>
               <p>At other times, he endeavours to perswade us, that this Dispute about the distinction of Bishops and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters does not concern the present Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie of Congregational Churches: Thus, when he alledged several Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies out of <hi>Ignatius</hi> his Epistles, he adds, <hi>We are no way at present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the Controversie about that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of Bishops and Presbyters, which the Writer of those Epistles does assert.—Although therefore there might</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 104, 105.</note>
                  <hi>have been, and probably was, some altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Order of the Churches, from what was of primitive Institution, yet was there as yet no such change in their state, as to make way for those greater altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which not long after ensued.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Those greater Alterations he means, is the multiplication and increase of a Church into more Congregations than one under the care of the same Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, with his Presbyters, who were increased also, as the increase of the Church required. Now, let any man
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:204354:221"/> judge which of these two is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Alteration, the increase of the Church, by the increase of Believers, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to more Congregations, or the alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the whole Government of the Church, from a parity to an imparity of Officers? How is it possible that such an Innovation as this should be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in the whole Christian Church, in an Age of Apostolical men, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed with the Apostles themselves, (as <hi>Ignatius</hi> did) in a time of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions and Sufferings, when the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopal Honour and Office had no tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Advantages to recommend it, but advanced men only to make them a fairer mark, and more exposed to popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Fury, without the least notice ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of it in any ancient Records. We may, with greater reason say, this is very improbable, than Dr. <hi>O.</hi> has to say it is probable; for it is easie to form fine Schemes of things in a fruitful Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and imagine how that may be done, which first should be proved was done; but this is not to write a History, but a Romance.</p>
               <p>But it is stranger still to say, that this does not concern the Controversie of Congregational Churches; for, have
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:204354:221"/> they any thing like a Primitive Bishop and Presbyters? if they have not, then their Churches are not agreeable to the primitive Form, and so have not so good a Plea for a Divine Institution, as Diocesan Churches have, which are still governed by Bishops and subject Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters. Yet, sayes Dr. <hi>O. We do main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi>

                  <hi>that there ought to be in every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Congregation, unto the compleatness of it, many Elders, or Overseers; that the number of them ought to be increased, as the increase of the Church makes it necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for their edification:</hi> But, if he would have dealt fairly, he ought to have told us what these <hi>Elders</hi> are, whether Lay or Clergy, whether they are such as must receive <hi>double Honour,</hi> that is, be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Nay, this Controversie about the Form of Government in the primitive Church, seems to me the most effectual way to determine the Question about Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational Churches: for Christ having not determined the Bounds of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es (as it does not yet appear he has from any thing Dr. <hi>O.</hi> has urged) if he have withall instituted such a Form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as is fitted to take care of a much larger Church than a single Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, it is a very probable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that he did not intend to confine a Church-state to a particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
               <p>Had the Apostles ordained onely a Presbyter or two in every particular Church they pleased, and when the number of Converts increased, ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more Presbyters, with their distinct Cures, as it is now in our Parish Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, it had been a good Argument they intended no larger a Church than a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Congregation, which one or two Presbyters might take care of: but when we find great numbers of such Elders or Presbyters ordained in the Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Churches, who took care of the
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:204354:222"/> Church in common, under the Inspection and Government of the Apostles, this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, that their Work either at present was, or in time was designed it should be, much greater than the care of a single Congregation: And I wonder what Dr. <hi>O.</hi> means, when he argues the other way, to prove those Churches planted by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, to be congregational; because, <hi>The Apostles appointed in them ordinary El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Orig. of Churches. p. 79.</note>
                  <hi>and Deacons, that might administer all Ordinances to the whole Church; and take Care of all the Poor—Now the Care, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection, and Labour of ordinary Officers can extend it self no farther than to a particular Congregation.</hi> He should have said to a particular Church; for ordinary Officers, if there be enough of them, may admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster all Ordinances to a great many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Societies united in the Communion of one Church. And what he adds, <hi>No man can administer all Ordinances to a Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eesan Church,</hi> is very true; but a great many may, and that I always took to be the Reason of multiplying Elders in the Church, to do that by many which one could not do; and I would fain see Dr. <hi>O.</hi> demonstrate, that a Church which has many ordinary Officers must be no larger than any one of them can administer all
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:204354:223"/> Ordinances to; and indeed, when we consider, that as Christians multiplied within the Precincts of any Bishop's Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, they were not formed into distinct Churches, under the Care of other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops; but the Presbyters were increased to take Care of them, and by degrees, the Bishoprick divided into distinct Titles or Parishes, with some fixed Presbyters over them, or at least, that some such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Titles there were, even as ancient as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time; and all this done without the least suspition of any Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Church-state, or the least no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice taken of any Change; the Fathers of the third and fourth Centuries firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, that they retained the same Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, which was in the Church from the Beginning. I say, the consideration of these things would incline any indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent man to believe, that though it is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, that in some places, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Christianity, or in the times of Persecution, a Bishop might have no more Christians under his Care, than might meet in a single Congregation; yet this was never thought essential to a Church-state, the Episcopal form of Government being sitted to take care of many Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations; at least, it is not sufficient to
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:204354:223"/> prove Congregational Churches, to shew that some Episcopal Churches were no bigger than single Congregations; unless he can prove, that this was standing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Rule among them, that none should be bigger.</p>
               <p>Let us now consider what he hints out of Antiquity, to overthrow this Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between Bishop and Presbyters; and he first appeals to <hi>Clemens</hi> his Epistle from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to the Church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> which we acknowledge to be a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable piece of Antiquity, but should much wonder, if there should be found any Passages in that Epistle, against Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, when, if we will believe the best Records we have of Church History, he himself was at that time Bishop of <hi>Rome:</hi> but let us consider what he says.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If there were at this time a Bishop in the Church of</hi> Corinth, <hi>he was either deposed</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Orig. of Churches. p. 90.</note>
                  <hi>by the People, or he was not; if he were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, he was only one of the Presbyters, for they were only Presbyters that were deposed; if he were not, why is he not once called on to discharge his Duty in curing of that Schism, or blamed for his Neglect.</hi> How many pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Hypotheses now might a man of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Fancy invent, to answer this Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction? Suppose we should say, that he
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:204354:224"/> was neither deposed, nor yet able to cure this Schism by his Authority, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, neither deserved Blame, nor wanted Exhortations to do his Duty. Suppose there were some Independent Brethren, who are for gathering Churches out of Churches, and for exercising their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Power over their Pastors, when they do not please them, who had set themselves up against their Bishop and Presbyters; to what purpose had it been to have minded the Bishop in this case of his duty, to cure the Schism? I believe the Bishop of <hi>London</hi> is as mindful of his Duty, and as heartily desirous to cure our Schisms, as the Bishop of <hi>Corinth</hi> could be; and Thanks be to God, is not yet deposed: but it would be a ludicrous thing, and a plain Affront, for any other Church or Bishop to blame him for not using his Authority, to reduce Dr. <hi>O.</hi> and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and their Brethren to the Unity of the Church.</p>
               <p>But, suppose their Bishop was deposed, then says the Dr. <hi>He was but a Presbyter, for none but Presbyters were deposed;</hi> that is, all those who were deposed, are called by the common name of Presbyters, and therefore, having the same Name, there could be no distinction of their Office,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:204354:224"/> which is the same Argument with what he afterwards uses, that <hi>Clemens mentions on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly two Ranks of Officers, Bishops and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons—other distinction and difference of ordinary Officers, besides that of Bishops or</hi>

               <p>But I wonder learned men will insist upon such Arguments as these, from the promiscuous use of Names, especially in the Writings of Apostolical men; for this very Argument would prove, that there was no difference between the Apostles and other Ministers of the Church in the Apostles days; for the Apostles themselves were called Bishops, Presbyters, Elders, Deacons, and many besides the Twelve, were called Apostles; and so it was in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-ages, though the Offices were distinct, the Names were common: and there is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Evidence, that so it was at this time, from this very Epistle.</p>
               <p>For one Argument he insists on to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of the Evil of their Schism, is <hi>from that Order our Lord in great Wisdom has appointed in the Celebration of holy Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>

                  </gap>) <hi>with a good Conscience, not transgressing the setled bounds of our Ministry, as it becomes comely Order.</hi> Here he makes three distinct Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the Christian Church of which he speaks, answerable to the High Priest, the Priests and Levites in the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church, which was a familiar way among the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, of characterizing and distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Orders of Bishops, Presbyters, and Deacons. And this is a plain Argument, that when two pages after, he mentions only Bishops and Deacons; he either uses Bishop as a common name for Bishops and Presbyters, or by Deacons understands Presbyters, as that name is sometimes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by the Ancients; and I am not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:204354:225"/> fair probabilities of either of these.</p>
               <p>As for the first, that the name Bishop may be used as a common name for Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Presbyters, when they are spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of both together (for it is question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Learned men, whether mere Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters <note place="margin">B. <hi>Taylor</hi> Episcop. asserted. Sect. 23.</note> were ever called Bishops, when they were spoken of by themselves, though Bishops are often called Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) is probable, because this name was promiscuously used in the Apostle's times, when <hi>Clemens</hi> lived, and conversed with them, which makes it likely enough that he might still retain the Apostolical Use of the words. But, besides this, we may easily observe in Ancient Writers, who acknowledged the Episcopal Prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, that they used to denote the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of the Church by some common name; for though the Authority of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Presbyters is very different, yet they both have Authority in the Church, and therefore when they were not concerned to distinguish the different degrees of Power, they included them <note place="margin">Orig. of Churches, p. 109.</note> both in one common name, as joynt Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of the Church. Thus, as Dr. <hi>O.</hi> observes, <hi>Justin Martyr,</hi> giving an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the state of Christian Churches in his time, <hi>mentions only two sorts of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,</hi>

And when he acknowledged just be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that besides their general meeting on the Lord's Day, they had frequent les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser Occasional Assemblies of the Brethren, where they met by parts: It is strange that he will allow them but one Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, be he Bishop or Presbyter, for all
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:204354:226"/> those Occasional Assemblies. Much at the same rate he argues, that he is not <hi>called a President with respect to any preheminency over other Ministers and Elders, like a Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesan Bishop, because he terms him only</hi>

Presbyters are not properly the Bishop's Flock, but subordinate Governours with him of the Church; and therefore his Office is most properly described by his Relation to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian People, as their Pastor or Shepherd.</p>
               <p>To give but one Instance more, <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> I think, will be acknowledged by all to own the Superiority of Bishops over Presbyters, who appeals to the Succession of Bishops from the Apostles themselves, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ib.</hi> p. 112.</note> whose Chairs they possess'd, and yet, in that passage which Dr. <hi>O.</hi> cites, as favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this equality, when he gives a general account of the Government of the Church, he includes both Bishop and Presbyters in one common name, and calls
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:204354:227"/> them all <hi>Seniores,</hi> which is the <hi>Latine</hi> word for <gap reason="foreign">

Now, it is sufficiently known, that in <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s time the Bishop was the chief <hi>Senior</hi> or Elder, who governed both the subject Elders, and the Body of Christians, and therefore we cannot think that he would leave out the Bishop, in giving an account of Church-Officers, without whom nothing was done in the Church; and if he does mention him, he must be included in the common name of <note place="margin">Viduarum &amp; Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos, nisi visitandi gratia ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niores ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ire non est opus, &amp; hoc cum Seni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oribus, hoc est, cum Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopo, vel si opus est cum Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteris. <hi>Ambr.</hi> off. 1. 20.</note>

               <p>Thus, that other Opinion, that when St. <hi>Clemens</hi> names onely Bishops and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:204354:227"/> by Deacons he means Presbyters, is not without some fair probability; for Deacon was not appropriated to that inferiour Office, which is now common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly signified by it, but was attributed to the Apostles themselves.

                  </gap>, Bishops: And St. <hi>Hierom</hi> upon the place, by these Princes understands Bishops, admiring the Majesty of God in appointing such Ministers, whom himself calls Princes; and so it seems <hi>Clement</hi> did too, by his altering the Text, and reading Bishops instead of Princes: and thus the Bishop is more than once called <hi>Princeps Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotum,</hi> the Prince, or Chief of the Priests or Elders, in ancient Writers; and then
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:204354:228"/> by Bishops, which he reads Deacons, he can understand nothing less than Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, for, though Presbyters may be sometimes called Bishops, it is certain Deacons never are: and when he gives an account of Church-Officers, no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der he mentions onely Bishops and Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, as the onely Persons who had any Rule and Authority in the Church. I do not urge this from any force I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be in the application of this Prophecy, but only as a probable way of understanding what he means by his Bishops and Deacons. These are the most material hints he has given to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the distinction between Bishops and Presbyters; and yet till he has done that, he will in vain seek for an Independent Congregational Church in Antiquity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But that which he promises himself more Success in, is to prove, that there were no other but Congregational Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, till the end of the second Century. But before we examine his Proofs of this, it will be necessary to inquire what he means by a Congregational Church.</p>
               <p>The Dean had proved that there were greater numbers of Christians in some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches, such as <hi>Jerusalem, Corinth,
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:204354:228"/> Ephesus, &amp;c.</hi> than could meet together in one Congregation, which is a Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that a single Church, even in the Apostles times was larger than a single Congregation, Dr. <hi>O.</hi> himself granting, that there was but one Church in one Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whatever number of Christians may be supposed to be in it: And I do not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that ever I saw a man more uncertain what Answer to return to any Objection, than the Dr. is in this case.</p>
               <p>For 1. he is not willing to own, that the Multitude of Christians in any City was greater than could meet in one single Congregation. He is willing to allow, that they had occasional Meetings, which did not consist of the whole Church, <hi>especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in times of Persecution—as may be proved</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Orig. of Churches. p. 358.</note>
                  <hi>by a Multiplication of Instances; but yet they continued one Church, and joyned together in all Acts of Church Communion properly so called:</hi> So that tho they might meet occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionally in parts, yet they used to worship God in one Body and one place, and so supposes, that there never were greater numbers in a Church than could meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for acts of Worship. How then does he answer that Objection, <hi>from the Multiplication of Believers</hi> in several Churches, beyond the bounds of a single
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:204354:229"/> Congregation? This he says indeed is <hi>all the Difficulty,</hi> and if he cannot untie the <note place="margin">p. 359.</note> Knot, he will cut it. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. He answers, <hi>Whatever Difficulty may seem to be in this matter, yet in point of Fact so it was, there was no Church before the end of the second Century, of any other Species, Nature, or Kind, but a particular Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church only.</hi> This is great, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise <note place="margin">p. 360.</note> those Difficulties which he cannot an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer. But how does this matter of Fact appear? Suppose he could prove, that <hi>de facto</hi> in some Churches there were no more Christians than met in one Congregation which no body that I know of, denies: yet here are two other matters of Fact as plain as that, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That there was but one Church in a City, how large or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous soever it were. 2. That in some Cities there were more Christians than could possibly meet in one Congregation, for Acts of Worship; and therefore such Churches could not be Congregational Churches, which require local and present Communion of all their Members. We do not oppose some Guesses and Conjectures to a certain matter of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ast, which is an absurd and foolish way of reasoning, to prove that that cannot be, which we see is; but we oppose matter of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>act to matter of
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:204354:229"/> Fact, which certainly destroys the Credit of all, if they cannot be reconciled; and therefore, suppose all the Examples he has given of Congregational Churches, out of Antiquity, were well proved, how does he reconcile these matters? That he can never do in his way, who places the essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial form of a Church in a single Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; but we can, who assert, that a particular Church must consist but of one single Congregation, when there are no more Christians than can meet in one place, but that it may consist of more when there are; and therefore, if he would prove against us, that the essential Form of a Church consists in a single Congregation, he must either prove, that there never were in any City for two hundred years, more Christians than could meet in a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Congregation, or that where there were, there were more Churches than one in that City, or, that tho there were more Christians than could meet in one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, yet there was but one Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational Church: but I fear he will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain again of this, as a very <hi>unpleasing Labour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. And he does indeed make a very bold attempt, to prove that there was but one Congregational Church in such Cities as
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:204354:230"/> had more Christians by half or two thirds than could meet in the same Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>For</hi> (sayes he) <hi>not all, not, it may be, half, not sometimes a third part, of them who made profession of the truth, and attended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the preaching of the word; nay, many of whom underwent Martyrdom, were admitted as compleat Members of the Church, unto all the parts of its Communion. Hence there were many, who, upon a general account, were esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Christians, and that justly, where the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were but small.</hi> Thus it is, if we will take Dr. <hi>O</hi>'s word for it, for he does not offer at the least proof. But I answer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. If Dr. <hi>O.</hi> can shew me any one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, in all Antiquity, of any baptized Christian who was not in compleat Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Church, unless he were under Age, or under Censures, I think he will do more towards the proof of an Independent Congregational Church, than has been done yet.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is very true, in the second Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, every one who profess'd to believe in Christ, was not immediately baptized, but kept in a probation state, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in the Principles of Religion, and trained up in the practise of it, as long as the Church saw fit, and such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons were called <hi>Catechumens;</hi> yet these
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:204354:230"/> very men constantly attended the publick Congregation, as the Penitents themselves did, though they were not admitted to the Prayers of the Faithful, nor the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of our Lord; and therefore these men took up as much room in the Church as if they had been in compleat Communion, and so this evasion can do him no Service. And yet,</p>
               <p n="3">3. This part of Discipline was not practis'd in the Apostles times; then men were baptized as soon as they profess'd their Faith in Christ, and joyned in all Christian Ordinances with the Church, and yet in these dayes we find numbers too big for single Congregations.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Supposing all these Christians had been admitted to compleat Communion, (as I suppose he will not deny but they might be, unless he thinks they must take their turns, and stay till there were room to receive them) could they be contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in one Congregation or not? if they could, then he might have spared all this, for it is nothing to the purpose; if they could not, must there be another Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational Church erected in the same City to receive them? or must they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue Christians at large without constant Personal Communion with any Church?</p>
               <pb n="370" facs="tcp:204354:231"/>
               <p>But, thirdly, he sayes, <hi>It does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that in the next Age after the Apostles the Churches were any where so increased in number, as to bear the least proportion with the Inhabitants of the Cities and Towns wherein they were.</hi> Supposing this, yet if they were larger than to be contained in one worshipping Assembly, it is a sufficient Demonstration against Congregational Churches. As for what he alledges of the Churches of <hi>Smyrna, Vienna,</hi> and <hi>Lyons,</hi> that by their own Epistles they appear to be so small, <hi>as that it was scarcely known who or what they were.</hi> I can find no such inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in those Epistles: there were a great many Christians that were not known to be so, such as <hi>Vettius Pagatus,</hi> a Person of great Nobility and Authority, who was not known to be a Christian till he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared as an Advocate for the Christians, and being asked the Question, openly owned himself to be a Christian; but this was not owing to the smallness of their numbers, but to their great care in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing themselves in times of persecution.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As for the Church of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> what he sayes about their <hi>coming together in one</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 362.</note>
                  <hi>place,</hi> I shall consider presently; but as for that Geographical dispute about <hi>Pella,</hi> though we should allow it to be but a
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:204354:231"/> small place, (which yet it does not appear to be, as the Dean has proved) yet we may easily suppose it big enough to receive more than a Congregational Church, and then it is sufficient for our purpose; for he cannot prove from the smallness of <hi>Pella,</hi> that there was but one Congregational Church at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> if it were big enough but to hold three or four Congregational Churches.</p>
               <p>I doubt not but <hi>Dr. O.</hi> was at least jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, that he could not by such little Arts defend himself from those clear proofs, that there were more Christians in some Cities, than could meet together in one Congregation for constant Communion, where there was but one Church, which therefore could not be a Congregational Church: and therefore he has another ingenious fetch, which, I confess, I was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much pleased with when I read it. For,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though he will not own the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Christians to be so great in any Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for two hundred years, as to make more Congregations than one necessary for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Worship, which had been too plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to give up his Cause; yet, he says, that <note place="margin">Orig. of Churches. p. 355.</note>
                  <hi>the multiplication</hi> (of a Church) <hi>into more Congregations without distinct Officers, will not at all help the Cause he</hi> (the <hi>Dean) plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:204354:232"/> for: for his Diocesan Church consisteth of many distinct Churches, with their distinct Officers, Order, and Power, as he afterwards describes our Parishes to do under one Bishop.</hi> And therefore, a little after, he acquaints the Dean what he must prove if <hi>he would advantage his Cause,</hi> viz. <hi>that there were in</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 359.</note>
                  <hi>one City, or any where else, many, not occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sional Assemblies of Christians or Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, but many stated, fixed Churches, with Officers of their own, peculiarly related unto them, intrusted with Church-power and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, at least, as much as he afterwards pleads to be in our Parochial Churches, all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Government of one single Bishop, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up a new Church-state, beyond that of particular Congregations, by their relation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, as their common Pastor.</hi> If he can keep the Dean to this, I believe truly he has him safe for two hundred years at least after Christ. But I have two things to say to this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That if the D. can prove, that there were more than one ordinary and stated Assemblies for Worship in one Church or City, he sufficiently overthrows Dr. <hi>O</hi>'s Proofs of a Congregational Church, which by the Institution of our Saviour, and to serve the necessary ends for which Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es were instituted (as he endeavours to
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:204354:232"/> prove) must consist only of one worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Assembly. Occasional Assemblies I grant do not so plainly overthrow Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational Churches, because, still all the Members of such a Church, which upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, may sometimes meet a-part for some Acts of Worship; yet, on set and solemn times, as suppose on the Lord's day, may, and must, and do meet together in one place; but if the Church consists of so many Members, that not half, nor a third or fourth part, can worship in the same place, this can be no longer a Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church, because they are not one, but many Congregations; and we must not call these occasional Assemblies, (under which Word, Dr. <hi>O.</hi> conceals his Fallacy) but fixed and stated Congregations, these supernumerary Congregations upon the Multiplication of Christians, being as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually necessary (if he will allow all Christians bound to worship God in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Assemblies) as the first Mother Church or Congregation was. And therefore, when the Dean proves, that all the Christians in a City, and the adjacent parts, made but one Church, and that there were greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Christians in such a particular Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than could meet in one Congregation: I cannot see what more is necessary, to
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:204354:233"/> prove that such a Church was not a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational Church; and Dr. <hi>O.</hi> has no way that I know of, to answer this, but either to prove that there were not more Christians in <hi>Jerusalem, Corinth, Ephesus,</hi> or any other City, than could meet in one Congregation, which he has not done yet and can never do, or else as the <hi>D.</hi> desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>That when the Christians in one City</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mbleness of Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. p. 235.</note>
                  <hi>multiplyed into more Congregations, they did make new and distinct Churches.</hi> I confess this was an unreasonable desire, but he must not blame the D. but the Unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness of his own Hypothesis for it. And thus the D. might well say, that <hi>distinct Churches in the same City was the thing to be proved,</hi> and it is a boyish piece of Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, for the Dr. to answer, <hi>This was not</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Orig of Churches. p. 357.</note>
                  <hi>the thing to be proved, nor did I propose it to Confirmation, nor assert it, but have proved the contrary unto the end of the second Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. This only I assert, that every Church in one City was only one Church, and nothing is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by the Dr. to the contrary, yea he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms the same.</hi> Dr. <hi>Still.</hi> indeed affirms, that there was but one Church in a City, but he does not surely affirm the same with Dr. <hi>O.</hi> who says, that there was but one Congregational Church in a City, when he ought to have proved, there had been
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:204354:233"/> more, if he would prove Congregational Churches. Learned men never betake themselves to such little Arts, but when their cause is desperate, and they resolved not to yield: thus we see the multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Churches into more Congregations without erecting them into new distinct Churches, was sufficient to confute the Dr's Pleas for Congregational Churches.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This is sufficient also, to prove what we now call a Diocesan Church, which is nothing else, but several Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons under the Care, Government, and Inspection of a Bishop and his Presbyters; no says Dr. <hi>O.</hi> this is not enough, unless he proves, that <hi>there were many fixed Churches with Officers of their own, peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly related unto them—all under the Government of one single Bishop,</hi> &amp;c. For such our Parish Churches now are.</p>
               <p>In answer to this, let us put the case, that a Diocese were not divided into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Titles and Parishes, with their fixt Presbyters, (as we cannot find they were for two hundred years) but through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Diocese, at convenient distances, there were Chappels or Oratories erected for the exercise of religious Worship; and the Bishop should appoint his Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, sometimes to attend one Cure, and
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:204354:234"/> sometimes another, with Authority to preach the Word, to administer Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to perform all those reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Offices, which now the fixt Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, or the setled Ministers of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Parish-Church are bound to perform: this is nothing more than a Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of several Congregations, under the Government of one Bishop and his Presbyters; and can it be thought in the judgment of any impartial man to alter the frame and constitution of this Church. If these Presbyters, who supply the whole Diocese by turns, should have their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Cures allotted, where they should constantly fix, and for which they should be accountable to their Bishop; the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly difference is, that this last way is more for the edification of the Church, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out altering the nature or species of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
               <p>It is time now to consider how he proves both from the practise of the Apostles, and the next Ages, that Christian Churches were only single Congregations: and, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ib.</hi> p. 78.</note> as to the Apostles times, he has three Arguments, which will soon be answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="385" facs="tcp:204354:234"/>1. Because <hi>there were many Churches planted by the Apostles in very small Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,</hi> but they were Provinces in which were several Cities; for we no where find, that the Apostles planted Churches in small Countrey-Villages; but their ordaining Elders, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in every City, and every Church, is the same thing, as the Doctor well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, from comparing <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 22. with <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 5. And as for what he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten urges out of the Epistle of <hi>Clemens,</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>that</hi> the Apostles <hi>preaching the Word through Regions and Cities, they appointed the first fruits, or first converts of them for Bishops and Deacons, of them that should after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards believe:</hi> though the signification of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is ambiguous, and there is no need of expounding it of Countrey-Villages; so as a learned man has obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 114.</note> there is no necessity of saying that the Apostles appointed Bishops and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons in Villages as well as Cities, but that they preached in Cities and Villages; for they did not ordain Bishops where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they preached. But what <hi>Clemens</hi> says, that the Apostles appointed Bishops
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:204354:235"/> for those who should afterwards believe, is a plain Answer to what he objects, <hi>That in four years after the ascension of Christ, there were Churches planted in all Judea, Galilee and Samaria, which was so short a time after the preaching of the Gospel, as that it is impossible they should be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be any other but single Congregations.</hi> For though we might reasonably account for this, from that miraculous power which accompanied the preaching of the Gospel in those days, yet we see this Apostolical Writer tells us, that the Apostle laid the foundations of Churches in many places, not with respect only to those who were converted to the Faith, but to those also which should be; and a Church from a small beginning may soon increase beyond the proportion of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Congregation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His second Argument for Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational Churches is, <hi>The Apostles ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing in them ordinary Elders and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons:</hi> But this I have already consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He argues, That <hi>it is said of most of these Churches expresly, that they respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively met together in one place, or had their Assemblies of the whole Church for the discharge of the duties required of them,
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:204354:235"/> which is peculiar unto Congregational Churches.</hi> He names several places, which I shall briefly consider.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 12, 22. The place concerns <note place="margin">Acts 15. 12, 22.</note> the first general Council at <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> In the 12<hi>th.</hi> Verse we read, that <hi>the whole multitude was silent, while Barnabas and Saul declared what signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles by them.</hi> Now <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> does certainly signifie, that there were a great many Disciples present, and that all that were present, were silent, and it can signifie no more: for though I grant the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude does sometimes signifie the whole body of Christian people, as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or Congregation does the whole Catholick Church, yet when it is applied to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Meeting, it can signifie no more than are present at that time; and it does not necessarily signifie the whole number of Christians, unless it be expresly said, that they were all present, which is not probable at such a Meeting as this was, which was not for Religious Worship, but for advice and counsel; especially when we are so expresly told, that the first Christians met in distinct Assemblies, for the exercise of Christian Worship, <hi>breaking bread from house to house.</hi> And <note place="margin">Acts 2. 46.</note>
                  <pb n="388" facs="tcp:204354:236"/> though this Meeting is called the whole Church, <hi>v.</hi> 22. yet it is most probable that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> there only signifies an Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Christians, not properly a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church; and my Reason for it is this, That the whole Church in this place is distinguished from the Apostles and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and so only signifies the believing people; and they are not a formal orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized Church, when considered by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but only a multitude or Assembly; and therefore the whole Church, <hi>v.</hi> 22. can have no other signification than all the multitude, <hi>v.</hi> 12. that is, the whole Assembly of private Christians then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. My other Reason is, Because the whole multitude of Believers were not then present; for this being a Council of the Apostles, to be sure Women were not admitted to these Debates, who yet are Members of the Church, and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly not inferiour in number to the men. So that though we should grant, that all the men who then were Members of the Christian Church were met together into one place, it does not hence follow, that the whole Church at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was no larger than a single Congregation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Wives and Virgins, and Widows, Children and Servants, who cannot be
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:204354:236"/> presumed present at this Council, must at least be allowed to make another Congregation, as large and numerous as this Council was.</p>
               <p>The second Text he directs us to, is an excellent confirmation of what I have now said: <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 22. <hi>The multitude</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 21. 22</note>
                  <hi>must needs come together;</hi> where by mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude he must understand the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Christians, if he will apply it to his purpose. Let us then consider what this multitude is, and that we may learn from <hi>v.</hi> 20. <hi>Thou seest Brother how many</hi>
                  <note place="margin">V. 20.</note>
                  <hi>thousand of the Jews there are which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and they are all zealous of the Law;</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which evidently denotes a number too great to meet in one Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, to take an account of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Preaching and Conversation: And yet this is the multitude which must come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; which is a plain demonstration, that multitude here does not signifie the whole body of Christian <hi>Jews,</hi> but such a number of them as will and can meet together, which are therefore called the multitude, because a great number will meet, and that no particular persons are ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ointed, but every one comes that will and can; and this is all I alledge it for: For I do not suppose, that these vast
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:204354:237"/> numbers of <hi>Jews</hi> which were now at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> were all constant Inhabitants there, and fixed Members of the Church of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> but a great many of them resorted to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> at the time of the Feast, from all parts of <hi>Judea,</hi> and other neighbouring Provinces: But all that I prove from hence is, that a <hi>multitude</hi> does not always signifie the whole body of Christian people, but as many of them as can meet together in one place, though it bear no proportion to the whole.</p>
               <p>Only I shall hence observe two things by the way, which do not very well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the Nature and Constitution of Congregational Churches, for which the Doctor now pleads. 1. That these Christian <hi>Jews,</hi> who were not fixed Members of the Church of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> yet when they were occasionally there, thought themselves as much concerned in all publick Affairs of the Church, and any publick Meetings and Councils, which concerned Church-matters, as the fixt Members of the Church of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> did; for it was for the satisfaction of those many thousand believing <hi>Jews,</hi> who were then occasionally at <hi>Jerus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>m,</hi> as well as for the fixed Members of that Church, <hi>that the multitude must come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</hi>
                  <pb n="391" facs="tcp:204354:237"/> 2. That St. <hi>Paul</hi> is here bound to give an account of his Doctrine and Conversation, in other Churches of his own planting in remote Countreys, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Church of <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> both which suppose, that all Christians then, whatever particular Churches they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to, looked upon themselves but as one body; and that they had equal Rights and Priviledges in any Church where they came, as in their own; and that the greatest Apostles themselves were not independent, but liable to give an account to other Churches of their actions.</p>
               <p>I would desire Dr. <hi>O.</hi> at his leisure to consider, how like this looks to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution and Government of an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Congregation. He refers also to <hi>Asts</hi> 5. 11. which mentions the Church <note place="margin">Acts 5. 11.</note> indeed, but does not so much as inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, that the whole Church was then present; for fear might come upon the whole Church, from that dreadful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Apostolical power and discipline executed on <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> though not the tenth part of them were present when it was done. Thus <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 2. it is said, <hi>The twelve called the multitude of the Disciples unto them;</hi> but we have already
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:204354:238"/> seen, that the multitude does not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily signifie the whole body of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians; here was a general Summons, but no more could come, than could be contained in one place, and yet it may well be called the multitude, when no man is excepted: and this not concerning acts of Worship, such a multitude as could come was sufficient, when the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision of the matter did not depend upon number of Votes, but the Apostolical Authority. The same Answer may serve to the instance of the Church at <hi>Antioch, Acts</hi> 14. 27. if we will suppose that there were at that time more Disciples at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> than could meet together in one place.</p>
               <p>The last instance he gives, is in the Practice of the Church of <hi>Corinth, 1 Cor.</hi> 14. 25, 26. though I suppose it should be the three and twentieth Verse where the great difficulty lyes. <hi>If therefore the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 23, 25.</note>
                  <hi>whole Church be come together into one place—when ye come together, every one of you hath a</hi> Psalm, &amp;c. So that it seems the whole Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> did meet together for Acts of Worship in one place, and therefore was but one single Congregation. Now there are two things wherein this whole difficulty
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:204354:238"/> consists. 1. Whether the <hi>whole Church meeting together,</hi> does necessarily imply their meeting in one Religious Assembly; for may not the whole Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> be truly and properly said to meet together for Christian Worship, though they meet in several distinct, but not separate Congregations; for the whole Church meeting together for Worship signifies no more, but that all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church do Worship God in the Publick Assemblies of the Church, though not all in the same Assembly and Congregation. And that the Apostle means no more here, is very plain from that direction he gives about Women, <hi>v. 34. Let your Women keep silence in the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">v. 34.</note>
                  <hi>Churches,</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which in the Thirty fifth Verse is immediately called <note place="margin">v. 35.</note>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>in the Church,</hi> which plainly signifies, that there was but <hi>one Church</hi> in <hi>Corinth,</hi> thereby signifying the whole Company of Christians united in one Communion, but yet there were seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Religious Assemblies, which he calls Churches, wherein this one Church met, and the meeting of the Church in these Publick Assemblies for Worship, is called <hi>the meeting together of the whole Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="394" facs="tcp:204354:239"/>2. But still there appears to be some difficulty in that Phrase <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which our Translators render <hi>in one place, if therefore the whole Church be come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into one place;</hi> for certainly this can signifie but one single Congregation, or one Assembly. I answer, it is very plain, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> does not alwayes signifie one place; as is evident from <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 26, 27. <hi>The Kings of the Earth stood up, and the Rulers were gathered together <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> against the Lord and against his Christ, for of a truth against thy Holy Child</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, <hi>both</hi> Herod <hi>and</hi> Pontius Pilate <hi>and the People of</hi> Israel <hi>were gathered together:</hi> where being gathered together <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> must signifie no more than an agreement and Conspiracy in one design, not a meeting in one place; For <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> the <hi>Gentiles</hi> and the People of <hi>Israel,</hi> never met together in one place for any such Consultation. Another use of the word we find in <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 44. <hi>and all that believed were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) and had all things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon:</hi> which being together, does not refer to their Religious Assemblies, but their common abode, and unless Dr. <hi>O.</hi> can prove, that there were no more Christians in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> after three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:204354:239"/> were Converted by one Sermon, than could live in one House, as well as meet in one Assembly, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> must not signifie one place, and then certainly the Christian Church may be said to meet <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in several Congregations, as dwell <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in several Houses. The Christians being together in the same place can signifie no more, than that they choose to live together in the same houses without intermixing with unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Jews, not that they all lived to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the same house, which could not be; and thus to meet together in one place, signifies that they all met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to Worship in Christian Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, not that they all met in the same Assembly. The very same Objection he urges from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 17, 20. and the same Answer will serve.</p>
               <p>Let us now consider, what evidence he produces for Congregational Churches, from the Ages next after the Apostles, till the end of the Second Century: and upon the most strict Examination I can make, of his Historical account of the State of the First Churches, I can find but two things he designs to prove by it, and if he can prove them, it is as much to the purpose, as if they were two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:204354:240"/> 1. That the whole number of Christian People belonging to one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church, met together in one and the same place, at the same time for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Worship. 2. That the exercise of Discipline, and the management of all Church affairs, Writing Letters or sending Messengers to other Churches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was all transacted in the presence and with the consent of the whole Church, which therefore could be no longer than could meet together in one place.</p>
               <p>As for the first of these, he proves it by those Phrases and Expressions used in Ancient Writers, concerning Church-Assemblies for Worship, that they used to come together in one place, <gap reason="foreign">

To this purpose he refers to several passages in <hi>Ignatius</hi> his Epistles, <hi>Justin Martyr, Tertullian,</hi> all very credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Orig.</hi> of Church p. 102, 104 108, 111.</note> witnesses of Primitive Practice.</p>
               <p>Now as for what concerns these Phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of meeting together in one place, and the like I have already showed, that they do not necessarily signifie the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the whole Church at the same
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:204354:240"/> time, in one and the same place; but only that Christian Worship was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in Christian Assemblies whither all Christians used to resort, in one if their numbers would permit, or in more if they could not, so it were in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of their Bishop and Fellow Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians. But for a farther confirmation of this we consider.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>Ignatius</hi> wrote these Epistles in his way to <hi>Rome,</hi> after he was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to be carried thither, and thrown to Wild Beasts, which was about the year 107. and it is not credible, that the Churches he directed his Letters to, planted in populous Cities, and founded by the Apostles themselves so long before, should have no greater numbers of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians than could all meet in one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, especially considering, that not only all the Christians in a City, but in neighbouring Villages, were reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned but one Church; as to instance in <hi>Ephesus,</hi> a City of great Fame, where St. <hi>Paul</hi> Preached three years with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable success, <hi>where those who studied</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 19.</note>
                  <hi>curious Arts burnt their Magical Books, and they counted the price of them, and found it Fifty thousand pieces of Silver, so mightily grew the word of God and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed:</hi>
                  <pb n="398" facs="tcp:204354:241"/> one can hardly imagine, that in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s time there should be but one Congregation of Christians, when he had Preached so long among them, <hi>that all they which dwelt in</hi> Asia <hi>heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks,</hi> and with such success, as was admired even in those dayes of Wonders and Miracles. Here St. <hi>Paul</hi> placed <hi>Timothy</hi> himself Bishop, who was his Companion and Fellow-labourer, and of the same mind and Spirit with him; and we may reasonably presume, that the Church of God would encrease and flourish under his instructions and Government. And therefore <hi>Ignatius</hi> in his Letter to them, takes notice of their <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>numerous multitude,</hi> and it is strange that this should be no more than one Congregation, after so many years encrease and growth. And yet this is the Church, which he exhorts to meet together in one place.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> wrote his Second Apology to the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour in the behalf of the Christians, as Dr. <hi>O.</hi> sayes, about the year 150. though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers assign another time for it: and <note place="margin">Ibid. 105.</note> being at <hi>Rome,</hi> and Writing to the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours, we need not doubt
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:204354:241"/> but he had that Church in his Eye, in that description he gives of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Christian Worship, and yet there he sayes <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>That on the day called Sunday, all that dwell in the Cities or Countries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, meet together in one place.</hi> So that if we will understand this strictly, we must own that in <hi>Rome</hi> it self, and all the Country about for a hundred and fifty years or more after Christ, there was but one Congregation of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and it is wonderful, that so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable a number of people, who took so much care to conceal them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from their Persecuting Enemies, should be thought worth taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of in so great and flourishing a City, which was the Seat of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and yet about this time began the Fifth Persecution, in which <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> himself suffered.</p>
               <p>Indeed there is no such thing can be concluded from <hi>Justin</hi>'s words, or we must prove more from it, than the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor would have, or than any body can grant; for <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> does not here speak of a particular Church, but of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Churches, planted in several Cities
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:204354:242"/> and neighbour-Villages, (for there was but one Church in a City, as the Doctor owns) and yet says, that they all meet on Sunday, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Tertullian</hi> takes no notice of any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <note place="margin">Ib. p. 111.</note> Church, but gives an account of the general practice of Christian Churches, which he calls the <hi>Christiana factio,</hi> not the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> as Dr. <hi>O.</hi> tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slates it, but the <hi>Christian Faction,</hi> which he so calls in contempt of that opprobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Name given them by the Heathens; or because <hi>Factio</hi> was anciently a good Name, to signifie an innocent and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Combination, Sect, or Party of men, united for the doing some good and vertuous Actions; and therefore immediately before he tells them, that they ought at least to reckon the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Sect <hi>inter licitas Factiones,</hi> among the lawful Factions.</p>
               <p>Of this Christian Faction or Church, <note place="margin">Tert. <hi>Apol. cap.</hi> 39.</note> he tells them, <hi>Corpus sumus de conscientia Religionis, &amp; disciplinae unitate, &amp; spei foedere: We are a Body or Society, united in a consent of Religion, unity of discipline, and Covenant of hope.</hi> This <hi>Tertullian</hi> writes of the whole Christian Church, or of all Christians, this being a general Apology for Christians, not for any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Christian Church; but Dr. <hi>O.</hi> would have him mean this of a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Congregational Church, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the Covenant of hope under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:204354:243"/> the independent Church-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and at this rate of dealing with ancient Writers, he may find an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Church in what Author he pleases.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tertullian</hi> proceeds, <hi>Coimus ad Deuns quasi manu facta precationibus ambiamus; We meet together, that with united force we may obtain the favour of God by our prayers.</hi> Here Dr. <hi>O.</hi> makes use of old Editions of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and adds, what is wanting in the latest and best Editions, <hi>In Coetum &amp; Congregationem, We meet in an Assembly or Congregation;</hi> but the matter is not much, which way soever it be; I am sure he translates or expounds it very false, when from these words he observes, that <hi>Tert. lays the foundation of Churches</hi>

<pb n="403" facs="tcp:204354:243"/> their eyes open, to impose upon others, (who see with their eyes) in so plain a case, there is less hope still.</p>
               <p>I confess it was a bold adventure for any man to call in <hi>Tertullian</hi> as a Witness for Congregational Churches, to prove, suppose that in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or the Church of <hi>Carthage,</hi> where he was <hi>Presbyter,</hi> there were no more Christians in his time than would make up one sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Congregation, when immediately before <hi>Tertullian</hi> tells them, <hi>Though we</hi> (Christians) <hi>have risen but of late among you, yet we</hi>

<pb n="404" facs="tcp:204354:244"/> number of men should but break company with them, and depart into some remote corner of the World, the loss of so many Citizens would confound their Empire, and punish them only by forsaking them; they would certainly be afraid of their own solitude, and that great silence of all things, and the lethargick stupor, as it were, of a dead World.</hi> And would any body now but Dr. <hi>O.</hi> believe, that in <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s time, there were no more Christians in <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Carthage,</hi> and other large and populous Cities, than might all meet in one single Congregation, though suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed as large and numerous as in reason may be imagined; five or six thousand people (which is a good large Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) could not easily be miss'd in <hi>Rome,</hi> where you may reasonably suppose some hundred thousands; and yet the case was the same in the Countreys as well as Cities, in proportion to the number of Inhabitants.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tertullian</hi> wrote this Apology not above 40 years or thereabout after <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> wrote his; which is a plain Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that the number of Christians was not so small at <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>Justin</hi>'s time, as to make but one Congregation; for it is not credible to think, that when the
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:204354:244"/> Gospel had made no greater progress at <hi>Rome</hi> in a hundred and fifty years, than to make up a Church of one Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in forty years more, in the heat of persecutions, when Mir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cles were either ceased, or were very rare, it should so prodigiously over-run City and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, as to equal, if not exceed the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Infidels.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Origen</hi> lived and flourished in <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria</hi> part of <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s time, and to his Testimony now and then the Doctor appeals; and yet it is evident from nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous proofs, that in his days a Church consisted of more Congregations than one. I shall take notice at present but of one place, which the Dean has noted before me, that he compares the Churches of <hi>Athens, Corinth</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> with the Corporations in those Cities, (which <note place="margin">Orig. c. Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum, 1. 3.</note> were not one but many) the number of <hi>Presbyters</hi> with the Senates of the City, and the Bishop with the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>And now if we should descend to St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who was Bishop of <hi>Carthage</hi> not many years after <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and had such a particular reverence for his Memory and Writings, that he called him his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and was the most zealous Assertor of the ancient Government and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:204354:245"/> of the Church, it is hardly credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that in such an Age of learned and inquisitive men, when their enemies had such a watchful eye over them, they should attempt any Innovation in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment or Worship, and if they did, that no notice should be taken of it either by Friends or Enemies. But Dr. <hi>O.</hi> dares not descend so low as St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> since the Dean has so plainly proved, that he is not theirs, and therefore stops without any reason, and indeed ought to have stopped a great deal sooner, if he had consulted the advantage of his Cause: For there is no shew of reason to imagine, that the third Century produced any new Alterations in Church-Government, as the fourth might, when the Empire became Christian, and the Sword was added to the Keys; but the Testimonies of the third Century are too plain in this Cause, and the Records of former Ages not so express and particular, but that a man of w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> it may with some Art press them to serve his Cause.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His second Argument to prove Congregational Churches from primitive Practice is, That the exercise of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and the management of all Church-Affairs, writing Letters or sending Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:204354:245"/> to other Churches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was all transacted in the presence and by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the whole Church, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could be no larger than could meet together in one place: And this is co-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident with the third thing I observed he endeavoured to prove in this History, <hi>viz.</hi> the Interest and Power of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Church-Government; this he over and over repeats, as the great support of his Cause, and the great thing he aims <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Orig.</hi> of Churches, p. 91, 95, 101, 102, 118.</note> to prove, as you may see in the margin; for I forbear transcribing particular pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages to save so much trouble.</p>
               <p>Now if the Right and Power of the People in Church-Affairs were duely sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, I should have no great Controversie with him upon that score; for it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly agreeable to Apostolical and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Practice, that the People should at least be present and consenting at the Election of Officers, the exercise of the Keys, or making any new Rules or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Discipline; but as for any inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Power and Authority to determine these Matters, they had none, as Dr. <hi>O.</hi> himself acknowledges, who rejects <hi>the Democratical Government of the Church,</hi> when he was charged with it by the Doctor, (though he had before plainly
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:204354:246"/> enough owned it) and tells his Readers, <hi>I never thought, I never wrote any such thing: I do believe that the Authoritative Rule and Government of the Church was, is, and ought to be in the Elders and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of it, being an act of the Office-Power, committed to them by Christ himself. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit my judgment is, that they ought not to rule the Church with Force, Tyranny, and corporal Penalties, or without their own consent.</hi> And thus he answers the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor's Objection, <hi>That it is very unlikely that the People would forego their Interest in the Government of the Churches, if ever they had any such thing, without great noise and trouble; for Government is so nice and tender a thing, that every one is so much concerned for his share in it, that men are not easily induced to part with it.</hi> To this he answers, <hi>No other interest or share in the Government is ascribed by us unto the People, but that they may be ruled by their own consent.—But from any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement on their minds, from the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Government, wherein their Concern principally consists in an understanding voluntary obedience unto the Commands of Christ, they had nothing of it.</hi> It was very fitting, that at the Election of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, the People who understood their
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:204354:246"/> Conversation and Temper, should at least be Witnesses and Judges of their moral qualifications; and if none were to be made a Bishop, but he who had a <hi>good report from those who are without,</hi> (Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans and Infidels) it was much more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable to advance any man to that degree, who had not a good report from the Church itself, and those people who were to be governed by him. Thus one design of Church-Censures is to put such persons to publick shame, and therefore is most regularly exercised in a publick Assembly, in the presence of neighbour-Christians, who must in some sort exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the sentence of Excommunication, which is inflicted by the Bishop, by withdrawing from the Conversation of such men. And thus People will yield a more willing and chearful obedience to Church-Rules and Orders, when they are established by their consent, which was especially necessary in those days, when there was no external Power to back the Authority of the Church, and which ought to be exercised as sparingly as may be, when other more grateful methods will attain the end: But of this more anon. But the Point I part with Dr. <hi>O.</hi> upon is this, That the presence of
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:204354:247"/> the whole Church is not necessary to this purpose, and that much greater numbers may meet upon such occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions as these, when there is need, than can be fixt Members of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational Church, and therefore the right of the People in Church-affairs does not prove the necessity of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational Churches; and I have a plain reason and a plain example for the proof of this, which is as much as can be desired in any case.</p>
               <p>My reason is this, because the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of Church-Government does not depend upon the Votes of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (which is to make Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment Democratical) for then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it were necessary that the whole Church should meet, or at least that they might, if they pleased; but their presence is required not to give Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to Church-Decrees and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, but for their own satisfaction, that all things are managed with due Counsel and Advice, and as may be for the Edification of the Christian Church, and five hundred serve as well for this purpose as five thousand; for in such cases as these, that which will satisfie five hundred men, not pickt and culled
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:204354:247"/> out to make a Party, but coming occasionally without any particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, must certainly satisfie all reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able men, and those who love to see and hear for themselves may come them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p>And upon extraordinary occasions, there may be a more numerous As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly than can meet in a single Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, as we know it has often been upon the choice of Bishops, not without great disorders from the heats and Factions of different Parties, which may and often do happen in less meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; though the inconveniencies of this grew so great, that the Church saw fit to restrain this power, and the true reason of these disorders was, that by noise and tumult they made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Electors, instead of being Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, and giving their consent to a wise choice.</p>
               <p>My example of the Exercise of this Discipline out of a Congregational Church, is the Church of <hi>Carthage</hi> in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time. I suppose Dr. <hi>O.</hi> will not now attempt to prove the Church of <hi>Carthage</hi> in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time to have been a Congregational Church; for he himself acknowledges,
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:204354:248"/>
                  <hi>that it is sufficiently manifest from his Epistles, that the Church of</hi> Carthage <hi>wherein he did preside, was so far a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church</hi> (a particular Church we grant, but not a Congregational Church) <hi>as that the whole body or Fraternity of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Orig.</hi> of Churches, p. 112.</note>
                  <hi>it, was admitted unto all advice in things of Common Concernment unto the whole Church, and allowed the exercise of their Power and Liberty in choosing or refusing the Officers that were to be set over them.</hi> He sayes indeed something more than what is true of the Power of the People of <hi>Carthage</hi> in Church-affairs, <note place="margin">Unreas. of Separat. p. 229. &amp;c.</note> as is evident from that accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate account the Dean has given of this matter, but yet thus much is true, that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> did not ordinarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine any matters of great and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick concernment without the advice of his Clergy and the consent of the People, which is a plain demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that the rights of the People in Church-affairs may be preserved in a Church, which is not confined to a single Congregation. This I think is sufficient to return in Answer to Dr. <hi>O</hi>'s Second Argument for Congregational Churches, from the Example of the
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:204354:248"/> Apostolical and Primitive Churches to the end of the Second Century.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His Third Argument to prove the Divine Institution of Congregational Churches is, <hi>that they only are suited unto the ends of Christ in the Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Church,</hi> which he persues at large thorough the Sixth Chapter, but upon a perusal of it, I find it only a larger Repetition of his first Argument, to prove that Christ hath appointed the Congregational Church and State, because <hi>it is meet and accommodated unto all the ends which he designed in his Institution of a Church.</hi> And what I have already answered to that, is a sufficient answer to this, which if I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand aright is the very same, and though I could take advantage to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course some things more largely, as he has done, yet I am contented to have said enough.</p>
               <p>Let us now consider Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Notion of <hi>Praesential Communion,</hi> and of all the Writers I know, I can least undertake to tell what Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s opinion is in any thing; for sometimes he seems to say one thing, and sometimes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and conceals himself under such doubtful and ambiguous expressions,
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:204354:249"/> that it is a hundred to one, if he do not charge his Answerer, whoever he be, with false citations, and mistaking his Sence, as he has served the Dean more than once, where I believe any Reader would have mistaken, as well as he, if it were a mistake, but this is a secure way to take care for a retreat, if he cannot conquer.</p>
               <p>In his Answer to the Dean, he will <note place="margin">Second Defence of Non-conf. p. 100.</note> by no means confine <hi>Present Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> to single Congregations, that <hi>must all meet at once in one place, but that as Neighbours and Citizens may have Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Converse and meetings</hi> per vices, <hi>of some at one time and some at another,</hi> but at other times seems to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly of Dr. <hi>Owen</hi>'s mind for Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational Communion, as I have already observed, and in his Treatise of Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy <note place="margin">Treatise of Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, p. 125. c. 10.</note> expresly chuses that way, and therefore urges the same Arguments which Dr. <hi>O.</hi> does, and endeavours to answer that Objection of Presbyterians against the Independants Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Churches <hi>(which,</hi> as he sayes, <hi>is the common and strongest Objection against</hi>

               <p>Many things he urges, are the same we have already met with in Dr. <hi>O.</hi> and I do not see, but that the same An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers will serve; it is not consistent with my designed brevity, to examine particularly every thing he sayes, who sayes a great many things, which I can imagine no other reason for, but to make up in number, what they want in weight; much less shall I examine
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:204354:250"/> all his numerous citations out of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Writers, who commonly does abound with such Citations, though with as little skill or Faithfulness as most men I know, some account of which will be given to the World, as I presume, before this discourse sees the Light; and therefore I shall only as briefly as I can consider the main force of his Arguments, whereon the whole hope of his cause depends.</p>
               <p>As 1. That which he designs to prove <note place="margin">Treatise of Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, p. 126.</note> in his Tenth Chapter of the Treatise of Episcopacy is, <hi>that the lowest true Political Church, must be neighbours united for Personal Communion,</hi> which he proves from Apostolical and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Churches of the first and second Ages, which I have already considered in answer to Dr. <hi>O. from the duties of Church-members, which are, 1. To assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble together for Gods Publick Service. 2. To have the same Pastors that are among them and over them, and Preach to them the word of God, and go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them by the example of a Holy Life. 3. To send to their Pastors when they are Sick to Pray with them, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise them. 4. To admonish a Brother that offendeth,</hi> &amp;c. To which I answer.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="417" facs="tcp:204354:250"/>1. I readily grant, that neighbour Christians ought to live together in the same Church-Communion, and I think this is no very good Argument for Conventicles, which disturb the Communion of neighbour Christians, and pick up a Church from all parts of Town and Country, whose Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers many times live at such a distance, that they never see one another but at their Meetings, much less are they capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of discharging the Offices of Church-Members to each other.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But yet the Duties which Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans owe to each other, do not depend upon their being Members of the same particular Church, but on their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Christianity, or their being Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Catholick Church, which is the Body of Christ, and of the same Communion; such as exhorting, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monishing, reproving, counselling, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting, relieving, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Neighbourhood gives the opportunity of discharging these duties, but common Christianity layes the obligation on us to do it, and we are equally bound to perform these Offices of Christian Charity and Communion to all Christians, as we have opportunity, as we are to those
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:204354:251"/> who belong to that particular Church, whereof we are Members; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no reason to confine the Communion of a particular Church to such a neighbourhood as will give us opportunity of such Christian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, because this is not a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar duty of a particular Church-Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but of common Christianity; and while all Neighbours live in the same Communion, though the Communion of that particular Church extend much farther than the Neighbourhood, these duties may be as well performed, as if the particular Church-Society were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the Neighbourhood.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I willingly grant, That Religious Assemblies for Worship are necessary to the Christian Church, but deny, that a Church must be no larger than a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping Assembly, as I have already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to Dr. <hi>O.</hi> for the duty of publick Worship does not depend on a particular Church-Relation, but on common Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity; and I am equally bound to worship God with all the Christians in the World, where-ever I am, who wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship our Saviour according to his own Institutions.</p>
               <p>The foundation of this whole Dispute
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:204354:251"/> is an opinion which Dr. <hi>O.</hi> and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> have embraced, that a Church-Member signifies something more than a Christian, and that the Members of the same parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church are more nearly related to each other, than they are to the rest of the Christian World; and therefore none can be of the same Church, but those who pray, and hear, and receive the Lord's Supper together. But this is a schismatical Principle, destructive to the very notion of Catholick Communion; it is not any distinct duty from Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Christian Communion, but necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which forms particular Churches; and if they can shew me any one duty, which Christians owe to their fellow-Members of any particular Church by vertue of a Church-Relation, which they do not by the Principles of common Christianity and Catholick Communion owe to all the Christians in the World, when they have opportunity to discharge it, I will yield the Cause.</p>
               <p>All the Christians of the World are Members of that one Body of Christ, which is his Church, as I have already proved; but they cannot all worship God in the same place, nor hear the same Preachers, nor live under the inspection
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:204354:252"/> and discipline of the same Rulers and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours; and therefore the Apostles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted particular Churches, not for the sake of any new Communion or Church-Relation, distinct from Catholick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, which is Schism, but to comply with the necessity of Affairs, that all Christians may enjoy those opportunities of Worship, Instruction and Discipline apart, which they cannot enjoy all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and yet continue united to all other Christians in the same Duties and Relations, as they have opportunity of discharging them.</p>
               <p>And therefore if we will argue from Principles of Reason, the bounds of a particular Church must not be confined to worshipping Assemblies, but at least extend as far as the exercise of Church-Government and Discipline can reach; for as necessity requires the Constitution of particular Churches, so Catholick Communion requires us not to crumble it into too small pieces, lest the whole do not well cement and hang together. Worshipping Assemblies are not peculiar to a Church-Relation, but a common duty of Christianity; and therefore more Christians may belong to the same Church, than can worship in the same
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:204354:252"/> place, or have a particular knowledge and acquaintance with each other.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I grant also, That every worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Assembly must be attended with one or more Church-Officers, who have Power and Authority to administer to them all the parts and Offices of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Worship, to pray, and read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or preach, and administer Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, admonish and reprove Offenders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nay, I grant it is very much for the Edification of the Christian Church, that such persons should reside among them, observe their Manners, and be Examples of holy Living to the Flock; but I see no reason, that the Bishop him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, who alone has full Ecclesiastical Power of Censures and Discipline, should be the man: But that is the Subject of our next Dispute.</p>
               <p>11. His next Attempt is <hi>to prove, That</hi>
                  <note place="margin">T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <hi>the nature of the primary Episcopacy, (or particular, if the word primary be cavilled at) is such as cannot be done in absence, nor</hi> per alios <hi>by Substitutes, in any of its proper parts, but only by a present Bishop or Pastor himself.</hi> And here he very warily like a true Distinguisher observes, <hi>That a Bishop may plow his Land, or build his House, or saddle his Horse, by another, and
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:204354:253"/> may appoint another to toll the Bell to Church,</hi> &amp;c. This is some favour how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that the Bishop is not bound to be of all Trades, a Plowman, Mason, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter, Groom, Sexton, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When he says a primary Bishop, he means a Parochial Bishop, as he else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where calls him, that is, every Parish-Minister, who must have all Episcopal Authority; and the way he takes to prove this is, by appropriating all the Duties of the Ministerial Function whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Bishop, that no man else has liberty, no not by the Bishop's License and Authority, (though he qualifies this with respect to Preaching, making him only the chief Teacher) to preach the Word, to pray for the People, to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize, to celebrate the Lord's Supper, to receive to Communion, to be the <hi>chief publick Reprover,</hi> (another qualification, because he knows private Christians ought to reprove one another) to be the <hi>chief publick Excommunicator of the obstinately wicked, and absolver of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, and to give the blessing to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> If he had but added chief to all this, we had had no Dispute with him.</p>
               <p>Thus as for private Applications, he tells you, The Bishop must do all in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:204354:253"/> resolve Doubts, hear Confessions, watch over the Peoples Conversation, look to the ordering their Families, visit the Sick, excite and quicken the dull and backward to their duty, take care of the poor, admonish, reprove, exhort, ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly persons: Here is work enough for one man, and I confess his Diocess ought not to be very large.</p>
               <p>But how does he prove, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop must do all this in person, and not imploy inferior <hi>Presbyters</hi> in most parts of this Work, and take care that they do their duty? Why to prove this, he <note place="margin">Ib. part 2. p. 8.</note> gives a description of the Bishop's Work out of the Scripture, and whatever duty is ascribed to any Church-Governours, Elders, <hi>Presbyters,</hi> Bishops, or what-ever Names they go by; all this he appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates to the Office of a Bishop, as that which he must do in person. And thus he takes the thing for granted, which is the main Question, whether those El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and <hi>Presbyters,</hi> which we read of in Scripture, were Bishops or not. But this he takes for granted upon Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>'s Authority; and why may not we reject Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s Authority, as well as he does the whole Assembly of Divines, and then I doubt he will want Arguments to prove it?</p>
               <pb n="424" facs="tcp:204354:254"/>
               <p>The Bishop indeed has the chief Power and Authority of administring all holy Offices; for a superiour Order contains all the Power of inferiour Orders: But there are some things which more peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly belong to him, as Ordination, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, and the supream Authority of Church-Censures in his own Diocess, and the inspection of all inferiour Ministers, and a supervising care of all Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal and Parochial Churches; that is, the Bishop succeeds into the Apostolical Power with <hi>Presbyters</hi> under him, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister all holy Offices by his Order and Direction.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> very learnedly proves, that a Bishop cannot have any Substitute to do his work for him; for this Curate or <hi>Substitute, or Agent, or Official,</hi> is either of <hi>the same Order with the Bishop,</hi> or he <note place="margin">Ib. part 1. p. 138.</note> is not; <hi>if he be, then he grants all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it grants him all;</hi> that is, if you will but allow every Minister to be a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, you may make Curates, or Agents, or Officials of them, or what you please, and he matters not; though methinks it sounds very harsh, that one Bishop should be Curate to another, that a Bishop should have no Bishoprick of his own, but should supply another Bishop's Cure.
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:204354:254"/> Well, but suppose these Curates or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes be of <hi>an inferiour Order, either the Bishop giveth him power and obligation to do the proper work of a Bishop, or not; if not, he is not hereby enabled to do it; if yea, then he hath thereby made him a Bishop; for to be a Bishop is nothing else, but to have Authority and Obligation to do the work of a Bishop; but if it be an accidental, or a common work, which another may do, it is not that in question, nor do we need the Office of a Bishop for it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for <hi>accidental and common works,</hi> we will except <hi>plowing and building Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> and <hi>tolling the Bell to Church,</hi> and such like; and speak only of <hi>the proper work of a Bishop,</hi> such as Preaching, Baptizing, and ministring the Lord's Supper, and those other Religious Offices, which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> says are proper and peculiar to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop: And in answer to his Dilemma I assert, 1. That most of those Offices he has named, are not so proper and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the Episcopal Authority, but that they may be performed by others who are no Bishops, without making them Bishops; and he has not yet proved the contrary from Scripture, and I suppose he will not be so hardy as to undertake to do it from primitive Antiquity, though
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:204354:255"/> I confess he is a valiant and couragious man. But 2. suppose that all these Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which <hi>Presbyters</hi> are ordinarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted to perform, did primarily belong to the Bishop, yet the Bishop's giving power to <hi>Presbyters</hi> to discharge them, does not make them Bishops; for as I take it, an inherent and a dependent Power and Authority does make two different Orders of men: Though there are some different Acts of Episcopal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, which were never intrusted to <hi>Presbyters,</hi> such as Ordination, Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet if there were not, this one thing would prove them different Orders; that Bishops act by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their Office, <hi>Presbyters</hi> by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of their Bishop; and it is not so much the things they do, as the power of doing them, which makes the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
               <p>But then says Mr. <hi>B. Nothing but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioning others is the proper work of the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ib. p. 159.</note>
                  <hi>Episcopal Order.</hi> But how does this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low? All Religious Offices are proper to the Bishop, as performed by his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, without whom nothing can regularly be done in his Church, by any inferiour Ministers; for I suppose all these acts are proper and peculiar to an Office, which
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:204354:255"/> none has Authority to do, but he who is invested with that Office, or derives his Authority from it: But <hi>then any</hi> Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>may</hi> in foro interno vel externo, <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily exercise the whole power of the Keys upon the Flocks; he may excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate and absolve publickly, as an act com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to his Flock with the Bishop, if it please the Bishop to give him power, which he may do without making him a Bishop.</hi> I grant the Bishop may give an ordinary Power or Authority to do this, but not an independent Power, for that is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the Episcopal Office; the Bishop must still retain his Power of calling him to an account, and rectifying any mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage he is guilty of in the discharge of his Office; for this is the proper Office and duty of a Bishop, which he cannot, which he must not part with: The King intrusts several Officers and Ministers of State with the discharge and exercise of all the parts of Kingly Power, but he does not give them an absolute and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable Authority, which would be to un-King himself, and make his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters King.</p>
               <p>But he <hi>enquires, Whether God be not the maker of the</hi> Presbyters <hi>Office? and whether God only (describing it) give not
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:204354:256"/> all the power by way of Law, Charter and Institution, and the Bishop give it not only by way of Ministerial Solemnization and Investiture?</hi> I grant all this, if he will but add, that God has made the Office of <hi>Presbyters</hi> in dependance upon and subordination to their Bishop, and that the Bishop does and can grant no other Power to them; and this must be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, if God have instituted an Order superiour to <hi>Presbyters</hi> in those very acts and duties, which are proper to the Office of <hi>Presbyters:</hi> The thing will be plain, if we put it in a Case, which is past dispute. The Apostolical Office will be acknowledged to be superiour to those <hi>Presbyters</hi> and Elders, which were ordained by the Apostles: Wherein then did this superiour Apostolical Order con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist? In Authority to preach, to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister Sacraments, to exercise Discipline, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All this belonged to the Office of Elders, <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and Bishops, (which Names were used promiscuously in those days) as appears from the description of those Offices produced by Mr. <hi>B.</hi> out of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epistles. What then was pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the Apostolical Office, which <hi>Presbyters</hi> might not do? Why, excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Ordination and Confirmation, or
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:204354:256"/> giving the holy Ghost, there was nothing peculiar to them, but that supream Power by which they acted; whereby they could correct what was amiss, and govern all other Ministers of Religion in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of their Office, and appropriate what parts of it they pleased to themselves, when they were present. But now if Mr. <hi>B.</hi> had been present, when St. <hi>John</hi> threatned <hi>Diotrephes</hi> for assuming an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controulable Power to himself, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing to entertain those whom he had sent; if he had deposed him from his Office, or limited the exercise of it, he might thus have disputed the case with the Apostle, as he proceeds to argue, <hi>Whether he, who is duely called to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storal Office, which God only made and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, must not (in season) do all the Works of that Office, whether men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission him or not?</hi> But I suppose St. <hi>John</hi> would have had an Answer ready for him; that men who receive an Office from God independent on any superiour Office, must do their duty, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting any new Commission and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; but if God have instituted their Office in dependance on a superiour Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, they must act in dependance and subordination too, and must expect the
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:204354:257"/> Directions and Authority of their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours.</p>
               <p>As for what he adds, <hi>or whether at least he any more need the Bishop's Commission for Church-Government, Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Absolution, than for preaching and celebrating the Lord's Supper, seeing both are now confess'd Acts, common to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the</hi> Presbyter <hi>and the Bishop?</hi> I answer, There is much more reason for the Bishop to keep the exercise of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline in his own hands, than Preaching and administring the Sacraments, because he can better exercise Discipline over a numerous Flock, than preach in person, and administer the Sacraments to all in his Diocess; and Church-Censures is a matter of that consequence, and liable to so many miscarriages, and requires so much prudence, that all <hi>Presbyters</hi> who are able to preach very piously, and to administer the Sacraments with all due gravity and devotion, are not fit to be intrusted with it: However a <hi>Presbyter</hi> depends upon his Bishop, as to the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of his Ministry in Preaching and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministring Sacraments, as well as in all other Ministerial Acts; and therefore there is no difference upon this account, but that the Bishop ordinarily grants
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:204354:257"/> Authority for one, but not for the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But is all giving of Power to another proper to the Bishop's Order?</hi> No, he cannot make a Constable; but what if it be? <hi>Then the Minister cannot give his Clerk power to choose the Psalm or Tune.</hi> This, I confess, is a material difficulty, which I did not think of before, and must take some more time to consider it; and if it proves unanswerable, I will hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter choose and set the Psalm my self, if my Clerk will let me; for I think Clerks pretend to the Bishop's License too in these Cases.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But may not a Bishop, if he please, also give power to the</hi> Presbyters <hi>to ordain, and to give other men power?</hi> I know not to what purpose this serves; for if he did so, there would be a great deal more to be said for the Ordinations made by <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,</hi> by their Bishop's Authority, than when they ordain in a Schism, and in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to their Bishops: But I have two things to say to this: 1. That the Bishop can impower men only to such Acts and Offices, as concern his own Diocess, which is his peculiar Sphere for the exercise of this kind of Power; for he cannot give any <hi>Presbyter</hi> a License to preach or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:204354:258"/> the Sacraments in another Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess; but Ordination respects the whole Catholick Church; and therefore the exercise of it must be regulated by the Laws of it, which have not formerly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed <hi>Presbyters</hi> to ordain, St. <hi>Hierom</hi> himself reserving Ordination as the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Act of Episcopal Power; though <hi>Presbyters</hi> were allowed to lay on hands together with the Bishop.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That which makes me suspect, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Bishop can grant this Power of Ordinations to meer <hi>Presbyters</hi> is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they having no plenary Power and Authority in themselves, but only in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence on their Bishop, their Office qualifies them to receive Directions and Power, but not to give it: Though how far the consent of the Bishop may go in this Case, I cannot tell, and don't see, how the present Controversie is concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in it.</p>
               <p>But <hi>is not Church-Discipline the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ib. p. 140.</note>
                  <hi>of the power of the Keys? If then the power of the Keys may be exercised by the</hi> Presbyters, <hi>when-ever the Bishops please, it seems it is common to them with him, as well as Sacraments, and therefore belongeth not to him as Bishop, but as a</hi> Presbyter. I answer, The power of the Keys may
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:204354:258"/> be exercised by both, but the Authority is only inherent in the Bishop; <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> are only qualified by their Office to exercise this Authority with the Bishop's consent, but have it not in themselves, as separate from their Bishop; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Bishop as a Bishop, not as a <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter,</hi> has the power of the Keys, as that signifies the actual exercise of it. The difference between a Bishop and <hi>Prssby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> with respect to those Acts which may be done by both, is this, that a Bishop has actual Authority to do it, a <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> has only a fitness, capacity, or qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, to do it with his Bishop's consent and leave, as it must be, where there is a superiour and inferiour Order and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, with respect to the same Acts and Offices. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> often says, that he dares not disown Apostolical Officers, whom he calls Bishops of Bishops, to be set over Parochial Bishops; and these are only those very Officers, whom we call Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesan Bishops; and if he will allow such superiour Bishops with Apostolical Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, his Parish-Bishops can be no other than our Subject-<hi>Presbyters;</hi> for Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical power over Ministers, is a superiour power, in the exercise of all parts of their Office, to direct and govern, to correct
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:204354:259"/> and restrain, to bound and limit the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of their power, as he sees fit for the common good and edification of the Church; for to be superiour to them in the same Acts, must signifie a power to direct, restrain, and govern Inferiours, in the proper Acts of their Office and Function.</p>
               <p>But <hi>if the commanding another to do an Office-work, be all that is proper to the Bishop, I ask (says Mr.</hi> B.) <hi>whether any thing there be proper to him? and so whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we must have such an Office? for may not the King command the Minister to do all the Work which belongeth to his Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? may he not appoint Magistrates, and make Laws to command it?</hi> &amp;c. But who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever said, that the Episcopal power is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to command another to do an Office-work? for a Bishop may forbid the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of that Office, the exercise of which he can enjoyn and command; but Mr. <hi>B.</hi> did not care to mention this, for fear if he took away this suspending and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencing power from the Bishop, he must give it to the King, and he does not like this power in any ones hand but his own.</p>
               <p>But cannot this eternal Distinguisher find some little distinction here? Is the
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:204354:259"/> Bishop's License and Authority nothing but a compulsory Command? A <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> has Authority indeed to preach and administer Sacraments, but it is in depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon the Bishop; and if a King commands a <hi>Presbyter</hi> to do his Office, he must command him to obey his Bishop, and exercise his Ministry in subordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to him; and I can easily guess, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> will pay the same obedience in this case to the Command of his King, as he does to his Bishop.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> says, that <hi>Grotius</hi> (to whom we do pay a very just respect, as he deserves) <hi>truely says, that that saying,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ib. p. 41.</note>
                  <hi>that what a man doth by another, he see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to do by himself, belongeth only to those actions, whose nearest efficient cause is not defined by the Law,</hi> (that is, which he is not by Law bound to do in his own person, but may do by a Proxy;) <hi>but sure when God made the Pastoral Office, he meant, that the Pastors called to it, should do the work, and not only appoint other men to do it.</hi> Most sure; and thus a Bishop ought to do the work of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, and a subject <hi>Presbyter</hi> of a subject <hi>Presbyter;</hi> and those who do not must answer for it, such as those <hi>Presbyters</hi> are, who refuse subjection and obedience to
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:204354:260"/> their Bishops in all lawful things. But if by this he means, that every Bishop must preach to his whole Diocess, and know every person in it, and take a particular account and inspection over them, I say, this is not the work of a Bishop, and I have a good reason for it, because the Apostles ordained <hi>Presbyters</hi> as assistants to the Bishop in this work, and therefore are his authorized Proxies, as far as he is pleased to imploy them; and there would be no need of this Office, if a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop must do all himself.</p>
               <p>But he adds, <hi>And I would know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the work of a</hi> Presbyter, <hi>(as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate and celebrate the Sacraments) may be done</hi> per alium, <hi>by one that is no</hi> Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter; <hi>if not, (as all say not) then I ask, Whether the Bishop's work or the</hi> Presbyter'<hi>s be most sacred? If the</hi> Presbyter'<hi>s, then his Office is more sacred; if the Bishop's, (or both alike) then that Bishop's work may no more be done</hi> per alium <hi>than the</hi> Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'<hi>s.</hi> This is most admirable Reasoning! but I will get off as well as I can.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then who taught him to distinguish the <hi>Presbyter</hi>'s from the Bishop's work? when the <hi>Presbyter</hi> has no work but what is more eminently the Bishop's, and what he does by his Authority and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:204354:260"/> which undermines the very foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of his Argument.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nor is it a very good Consequence, that because God by Apostolical Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, has made <hi>Presbyters</hi> subject to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, to minister in holy things by their Consent and Order, that therefore sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject <hi>Presbyters</hi> must have an inferiour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of subject <hi>Presbyters</hi> under them, to do their work: There is no such Order appointed, and that is a sufficient Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that there is no need of it; for if there be too few <hi>Presbyters</hi> to do the work, the Bishop has Authority to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain more, and such Proxies, Vicars, or Substitutes, must not be subordinate to one another without end, and therefore must stop, where the reason ceases.</p>
               <p>As for what he urges to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, about the exercise of Discipline and Church-Censures, for confining a Church to a single Congregation, where the Bishop is constantly present, all these pretences have been already so shamefully baffled by Mr. <hi>Dodwell,</hi> in his Letters to Mr. <hi>B.</hi> lately published, that no man need concern himself farther in that Cause.</p>
               <p>Thus I have shewn, that <hi>local, personal, presential Communion,</hi> is not essential to the notion of a Church; that a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:204354:261"/> Church needs not be confined to the narrow bounds of a single Congregation; and therefore I proceed now to explain what that Christian Communion is, which is essential to the Constitution of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Diocesan Church, which I shall briefly do in three Particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That all who live within the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts of such a Church, meet together with their neighbour-Christians, at pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and solemn times and places for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Worship: This will be readily granted by all, that publick Worship is an essential Church-duty, wherein the Communion of Christians with each other consists; to be sure our Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries will not deny this, who make it es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential to the notion of a particular Church, that all the members of it meet together in the same place.</p>
               <p>And that we ordinarily communicate in all the Offices of Religion with our neighbour-Christians, is necessary to Christian Communion, at least that it be within the Communion of the same Church: Common Christianity makes us members of the Catholick Church; and this obliges us to Christian Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and the place of our Habitation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines our Communion to that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:204354:261"/> Church where we dwell; for Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Communion requires us to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with any true Church where we are; and designedly to avoid the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of any Church, where we can communicate without sin, is a breach of Catholick Unity and Communion; for he who refuses the Communion of any one true Catholick Church, does not live in Catholick Communion, and therefore is a Schismatick.</p>
               <p>And this I take to be the true Reason, why the Apostles planted but one Church in a City and its Territories, though it were never so large, that neighbour-Christians might all live in the same Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, under the same Discipline and Government, that there might be no Schisms and Emulations occasioned by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Communions, which we have too much reason to believe might have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, when we consider, how apt they were to break out into Sidings and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in the same Church.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> indeed upon the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <note place="margin">Second Defence of Non-Conf. p. 101.</note> of Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> and <hi>Grotius,</hi> seems to assert, that there were in the Apostles days two Bishops, at least in some Cities, and two distinct Communions of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles; that</hi> Peter <hi>at</hi> Rome <hi>was
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:204354:262"/> Bishop of the</hi> Jews, <hi>and</hi> Paul <hi>of the</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles. Now though in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time, it was a fixed Rule, that there should be but one Bishop in a Church; upon which account among others he rejects the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of <hi>Novatianus,</hi> because <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> was elected Bishop by much the Majority of Bishops, <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and actually ordained and possess'd of his Chair, before the clandestine Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of <hi>Novatianus;</hi> and it seems it was then a standing Rule, that after there is a Bishop canonically elected and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, there could not be a second: but sometimes it happened, that two Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops were ordained either by different Factions and Parties, or when the Church was divided by Schisms, as in the time of the <hi>Donatists</hi> and <hi>Arians;</hi> and to compose such Differences, it has in some Cases been agreed by Councils, that they should both exercise Episcopal Power, and live in the same Communion, which is the Case Mr. <hi>B.</hi> mentions at <hi>Antioch</hi> between <hi>Flavianus</hi> and <hi>Evagrius;</hi> in some Churches when the Bishop grew ancient, he ordained his Successor while he himself lived, who governed the Church with a joynt Authority; and though they had two Bishops, they had
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:204354:262"/> but one Church, which was St. <hi>Austin</hi>'s Case, who was made Bishop in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessor's time. And this is the reason of that observation <hi>Epiphanius</hi> makes of the Church of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> as Dr. <hi>O.</hi> has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Orig.</hi> of Churches, p. 356.</note> that they never had two Bishops as other Churches had, which he assigns as the cause of that Dispute which was among them, about choosing <hi>Meletius</hi> Bishop; for their Bishop was dead with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any surviving Bishop to succeed him, it not being the custom of that City, as it was in some others, to have a new Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop chose, before the old one was dead.</p>
               <p>But yet that there were two Churches at <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Antioch</hi> in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s days, one of <hi>Jews,</hi> another of <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who had their distinct and separate Communions, I must see very well proved, who ever says it, before I will believe it; much less will I believe, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> was the Bishop of one of these separate Churches, for so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed two distinct Communions to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> is no better than a Separation.</p>
               <p>This is that very thing which St. <hi>Paul</hi> did so earnestly endeavour to prevent in his Epistles to several Churches, where there was any danger of it: For this he
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:204354:263"/> reproved St. <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Antioch,</hi> who by his <note place="margin">Gal. 2. 12, 13.</note> complyance had like to have occasioned a Schism between <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi> For this purpose (as the Dean observed in his Sermon, which occasioned all this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute) he writes his Epistle to the <hi>Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and warns the Christians at <hi>Rome</hi> of such factious Zealots, who would break Communion with the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> unless they would be circumcised and keep the Law.</p>
               <p>This, as the Dean truely observed, was the Apostle's great design in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> to preserve one Communion among them, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> between whom the Dispute and Difference was; and therefore chose these words, <hi>Nevertheless, whereto we have</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 16.</note>
                  <hi>already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing,</hi> as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Text against Separation. Dr. <hi>O.</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes very warmly about the meaning of the Apostle in these words, and will by no means allow, that the Apostle here had any reference to their observing the same Rules of Worship, and living in the same Communion, which was all the D. designed to prove from them. It would be too tedious, and not much to my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Design, to examine particularly
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:204354:263"/> what Dr. <hi>O.</hi> has objected, and the Dean answered, and the Dr. again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in this cause; and therefore I shall only briefly prove; that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of the Apostle in this place is to perswade them to one Communion, to Worship God together, and not to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide into Separate Assemblies of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are both agreed, that the rule the Apostle here gives concerns the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences between the believing <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> Converts about observing the Law of <hi>Moses:</hi> Only Dr. <hi>O.</hi> would <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Orig.</hi> of Churches, p. 263.</note> have the Apostle in the beginning of the Chapter, when he warns them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>dogs,</hi> and <hi>evil workers,</hi> and the <hi>Concision,</hi> to mean the unbelieving Jews, who persecuted the Christian Name and Church, such as he says he describes in the Epistle to the <hi>Thessalonians. For ye</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Thess. 2. 14, 15, 16, 17.</note>
                  <hi>brethren became followers of the Churches of God, which in Judaea are in Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus: for ye also have suffered the like things of your Country-men, even as they have of the Jews, who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own Prophets, and have persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us, and they please not God, and are contrary to all men, forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles, that they might be saved;</hi>
                  <pb n="444" facs="tcp:204354:264"/> but I confess it seems difficult to me, whom the Apostle means in these words. The latter clause of their Character, <hi>forbidding us to speak to the</hi> Gentiles, seems to infer, that they were <hi>Jews</hi> who pretended to believe in Christ, but would not allow the Apostles to Preach to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> at least not to receive them into the Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Circumcision, and obedience to the Law, for unbelieving <hi>Jews</hi> were not particularly concerned about their Preaching to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but opposed their Preaching Christ at all. But then that other part of the Character, that they killed the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> and their own Prophets, and Persecuted the Christian Churches in <hi>Judea,</hi> and the Apostles; seems to point out the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing <hi>Jews,</hi> as Dr. <hi>O.</hi> applies them; but there is no necessity of that, since it is sufficiently known, that these hot bigotted Zealots for their Law, did joyn even with unbelieving <hi>Jews,</hi> in Persecuting the <hi>Jewish</hi> Christians, who Communicated with <hi>Gentile</hi> Converts, as Apostates from their Law, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though they pretended to believe in Christ, yet the Apostle reckons them still among Infidels or Apostates; and
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:204354:264"/> St. <hi>Paul</hi> expresly tells us, that he was Persecuted by these men for Vindicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the liberty of the <hi>Gentile</hi> Christians. <hi>And I Brethren, if I yet Preach Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, why do I yet suffer Persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 11.</note>
                  <hi>then is the offence of the Cross ceased.</hi> Which supposes that he was Persecuted for not Preaching Circumcision.</p>
               <p>And therefore I doubt not but by <hi>Dogs,</hi> and <hi>Evil-doers,</hi> and <hi>the Concisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> the Apostle means, as the D. ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served those Zealots for the Law, who endeavoured to rend and divide the Church, and Separate believing <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> from each other; those very men, whom in the Epistle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> he wishes were cut off. <hi>I would they were even cut off which trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 12.</note>
                  <hi>you,</hi> for these were the men they were more in danger of than the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest Enemies to Christianity, whose work it was to Persecute the name of Christ, not to sow Dissentions and make par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties among Christians, and who could not so easily deceive the believing <hi>Jews,</hi> while they themselves continued Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels.</p>
               <p>There were indeed, as Dr. <hi>O.</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves another sort of Jews, <hi>who acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>escing</hi>

               <pb n="447" facs="tcp:204354:265"/>
               <p>Against the dividing <hi>Jews,</hi> who would have made two Churches of the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the Apostle cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the <hi>Philippians</hi> in this Chapter: he tells them the perfection of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity consists <hi>in forgetting those things which are behind,</hi> that is the <hi>Jewish</hi> Law, and <hi>reaching forth unto those things which are before,</hi> that is the Gospel of Christ, in obedience to which alone, we can obtain the price of our call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>let us therefore as many as are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect be thus minded,</hi> that is, not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our selves about legal observances, which are of no value, but govern our Lives by the Laws of the Gospel, <hi>and if in any thing you be otherwise minded,</hi> that is, if any of you still think, that you are bound to obey the Law of <hi>Moses, God shall reveal even this unto you:</hi> wait patiently till you be better instructed without breaking the Peace and Communion of the Church. And then follows that Rule, about which the dispute has been; <hi>Nevertheless whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.</hi> Now this the Dr. does very well, and very agreeable to the scope of the place refer to one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion;

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cope and design of the place, and argues truly; and there is one plain Observation, which has not been expresly taken notice of, which I think will confirm all this and put it out of dispute. And that is this, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> signifies those things wherein they were all agreed <hi>whereto we have attained</hi> being opposed to those different apprehensions, which they had about the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> some having a more perfect knowledge of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which delivered them from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving the Law, others <hi>being otherwise minded,</hi> and still retaining a greater veneration of the Law, which kept them in bondage under it; but sayes the Apostle setting aside these different ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:204354:266"/> of things, <hi>whereto we</hi> (all) <hi>have attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.</hi> Now what was that wherein both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> agreed? That is easily answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it was the belief of the Christian Religion, the Faith and Worship of Christ; this they both equally believed, this was that, whereunto all had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and therefore in these matters sayes he, whatever our different attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and apprehensions may be in other things, <hi>let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.</hi> That is, let us maintain the Communion of the Church in the Faith and Worship of Christ, and not separate from each other, as if we did not believe in, and worship the same God and Christ.</p>
               <p>For we may observe, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies about the Law did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Christian Worship, such as Circumcision and the differences of Meats and Drinks, which related more to private Conversation, than publick Worship, and therefore in these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the Apostle gives the rule of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual forbearance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. commands them <hi>to receive those who are weak in the Faith,</hi> that is, to all parts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:204354:267"/> Communion, as it respects publick Worship or private Conversation; but not to enter into doubtful disputes about other matters; and that offence and scandal he warns them to avoid, seems to refer principally to that great tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation of breaking Church-Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which the Apostle by all means, so industriously endeavoured to prevent, and therefore tells them, <hi>that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God,</hi> or the Christian Church, Religion and Worship <hi>is not meat and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost, for he that in these things serveth Christ, is acceptable to God and approved of men:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore these disputes about the Law ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no influence upon Christian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and Worship, they ought not to separate upon this score, nor by an uncharitable use of their liberty to tempt others to separate.</p>
               <p>So that the Apostles Precept here is, that Christian <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> should all unite upon the common Principles of Christian Faith and Worship, and in these matters observe one and the same rule, Worship Christ in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and with united minds and hearts, and this is a plain justification of all
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:204354:267"/> the Dean concluded from these words, that Christians must live in the same Communion, and observe the same rule of Worship, whatever their different attainments might be in other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>For this is not a general rule in all cases, that whereto we have attained we must walk by the same rule; that we must unite only in those things wherein we agree, which will not end any dispute in the Church, nor cure any one Schism; for if we consider, how many different opinions there are in matters of Worship at this day among us, which are so far distant, that there is not any part of Worship, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the modes and circumstances of it, wherein all agree, how can we apply this rule to cure our divisions, it being impossible for all parties to agree in any one standing rule of Worship; but the Apostles rule is, that they should lay aside the disputes about the <hi>Jewish</hi> law, and agree upon the received rules of Christian Faith and Worship, that they should not divide into distinct and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Communions, but observe the same rule, and Worship God with one heart and mind, and this Explication
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:204354:268"/> suggests several things, which evidently shew, how applicable these words were to the Dean's design in opposing Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the rule of Christian for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance concerns only such different opinions and practices, as might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist with the peace and unity of the Church, and the Communion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians in the same acts of Worship; such as the disputes about meats and drinks, and other legal observances were; but St. <hi>Paul</hi> never thought any mistake to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, which made Christians separate from each other; the reason of that rule of Christian forbearance, was not to perswade the differing parties of Christians not to cut one anothers throats, but not to divide the Church, and separate into opposite Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and therefore he who treats the believing <hi>Jews</hi> with too much gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, who allowed the <hi>Gentiles</hi> their Christian liberty, though they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves observed the law, expresses the greatest indignation and zeal against those <hi>Jews,</hi> who would not receive the uncircumcised though believing <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> into the Church, but perswaded the Christian <hi>Jews</hi> to separate from
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:204354:268"/> them, calls them <hi>Dogs</hi> and <hi>Evil workers</hi> and <hi>the Concision,</hi> which is nothing else but Dividers and Separatists, and <hi>wishes that they were even cut off;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Dr. <hi>O.</hi> and others, who would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply this to forbearing all Christians of different apprehensions, who divide and separate into opposite Churches and Communions, do greatly mistake the Apostles design, who never dreamt of such a forbearance as this, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them to exercise mutual forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in order to their receiving one another, that is, living in the same Church-Communion and Fellowship with each other, not to their living peaceably in Separate Churches.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That those Christians who live to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the same Church, must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the same rule of Worship; but sayes Dr. <hi>O.</hi> what is this rule? <hi>if it reach our case, it must be such as requires</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ib. p. 270.</note>
                  <hi>things to be observed, as were never Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely appointed, as National Churches, Ceremonies, and modes of Worship.</hi> Now the plain answer is this, that let the rule of Worship be what it will, it must be but one in the same Church; they must all observe the same rule, which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to Communion and Uniformity
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:204354:269"/> of Worship; they must not set up di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct and separate Churches with op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite rules of Worship, for this is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive of Christian Communion. 2. No doubt but the Apostle refers to that rule of Christian Worship, which was then practised among them, which they then knew very well, and which we all know was agreeable to the general rules of the Gospel, though it might vary in several Churches in some modes and circumstances; and this is to be our rule still as the D. well answered, to conform our Worship to the nature of Christian Religion, and the general rules of the Gospel, which is all that can be required of us, when there is no perfect standing platform of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in all the parts and circumstances of it prescribed in Scripture, <hi>to observe those things which although they be not particularly commanded by God, yet are enjoyned by lawful Authority, provided that they be not unlawful in themselves, nor repugnant to the word of God:</hi> and Dr. <hi>O.</hi> may deny this still if he pleases, which is the only answer he gives to it; but will never be able to disprove it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another thing I observe in the words is, that at least we must not
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:204354:269"/> break the Peace and Communion of the Church, upon account of any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, which do not immediately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence our Worship. Notwithstanding their disputes about meats and drinks between <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Worship was the same, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore herein they must unite, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear each other in other matters: and if Mr. <hi>B.</hi> would have observed this rule, how many Objections against Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, or Lay Communion, would it have prevented and answered, with which he has now troubled the World; Indeed according to this rule, no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence should be sufficient for Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but what does immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the nature and Administration of Religious Worship; if the Worship be lawful and true Christian Worship, we must observe the same rule, <hi>whatever other differences there may be between us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That I may not be thought to wrong Mr. <hi>B.</hi> in this, I shall give some plain instances of it, and leave other men to judge, how well he has observed the Apostolical rule, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> charges the <note place="margin">Second Defence of Non-conf. p. 64, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> Dean with, saying <hi>that there is no other reasons of Separation because of the Terms of our Communion, than what was from
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:204354:270"/> the beginning of the Reformation.</hi> Though these are not the Deans words, who sayes, <hi>that although the present reasons for Separation would bave held from the beginning of the Reformation, yet no such thing was then practised, or allowed by those, who were then most zealous for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation:</hi> wherein Mr. <hi>B.</hi> endeavours to conceal the force and design of the D's Argument from the judgment and practice of former Dissenters, whose names they still glory in, to shew the unexcusableness of the present Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even upon the Principles of old Non-conformity.</p>
               <p>But let us take it as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> proposes it, and see what other reasons there are for Separation now, than the Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists had in former times. And they are in number Five.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>As to the things imposed now which were not them.</hi> And here he reckons. 1. <hi>The Vestry Act. 2. The Act of Ʋni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity. 3. The Corporation Act, all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring to renouncing the Covenant and Obligation of it for themselves and others,</hi> which is his 4. Now these indeed were not in being before, because the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was not. But what is this to the Terms of Communion? cannot men
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:204354:270"/> joyn in all the lawful and enjoyned Acts of Worship, unless they be Vestry-men, or Ministers, or Schoolmasters, or Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Sheriffs, and Common-Council<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men? If they scruple renouncing an ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal and sinful Covenant, cannot they worship God without renouncing it? un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less they think their Covenant obliges them not to comply with such Church-Administrations, as to endeavour the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation of them, when they can.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Re-ordination was not required in former times,</hi> and I know not how it should, when there were none to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordained? But may not they worship as Lay-men, (as some think they are no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) if they cannot act as publick Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters? And what are the People concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this Dispute, who are neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to be ordained nor re-ordained? And how does this justifie Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and many others, who have no need of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination?</p>
               <p>But 6. <hi>Assent and Consent was not then required:</hi> Nor 7. <hi>the false Rule for finding</hi> Easter-day: Nor 8. <hi>the new Doctrine of the undoubted Salvation by God's Word, that baptized dying Infants are saved:</hi> Nor 9. <hi>the word Pastor, as applied to Parish-Ministers, distinct from Curates,
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:204354:271"/> blotted out of most places in the Liturgie:</hi> Nor 10. <hi>the</hi> Oxford <hi>Act to banish Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters five miles from all Cities,</hi> &amp;c. Nor 11. <hi>were Ministers, and Corporations, and Vestries, bound to swear or subscribe, that it was unlawful on any pretence whatsoever to resist any commissionated by the King.</hi> Most of these things have been already accounted for, in his Answer to his <hi>Search for a Schismatick;</hi> but all the enquiry is now, how any of these things, though never so truely alledged, can justifie Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, when not any one of them is made a necessary term of Lay-Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Was not the Dispute between the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> about the obligation of the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> much more consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable than any of these, and yet because they did not influence the terms of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, the Apostle commands that they should be laid aside, and that they should joyn together in the same Rule of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Worship?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another difference he makes <hi>in the drift and tendency of these Impositions:</hi> The plain meaning of which is to charge our Governours with ill Designs, when they command no ill thing; which is a very loyal, peaceable and Christian tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: but if other men command good
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:204354:271"/> things with an ill De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ign, why cannot they obey them with a good one?</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Another difference is in the Effects.</hi> As 1. <hi>then</hi> (in former times) <hi>open Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and gathering Assemblies by non-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists, would have greatly offended the Prince; but our King by his Declaration at</hi> Breda, <hi>and his three first Declarations, and by his Licenses and Connivence, shewed such wisdom and clemency, as intimated less displeasure at our liberty:</hi> And well they have rewarded him for it! But are not his Acts of Parliament of as great Authority as his Declarations? Is the peace and unity of the Church no duty, but as it pleases or displeases the King? Was the Design of his Majesties Clemency to harden them in Faction and Schism? Did Mr. <hi>B.</hi> consider, what an untoward Argument that was to convince the King of the necessity of executing Laws, to convince them of the necessity of obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? 2. Separation in former times <hi>would have deprived most of the non-Conformists of their hopes of publick liberty in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish-Churches, which most of them enjoyed; but we had neither possession nor expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of such a thing.</hi> 1. I answer, What does this concern the Peoples Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? 2. What does it concern the non-Conforming
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:204354:272"/> Ministers Lay-Communion? 3. Does hope or despair of greater liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, make the terms of Communion more or less sinful in themselves? This is an admirable Casuist, and we learn from him the size and rule of a non-Conforming Conscience: This is foul play, to justifie themselves, by bringing a reproach upon the ancient <hi>Puritans,</hi> many of whom, I hope, were honester men.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In former times Separation <hi>would have hindred and hazarded the progress of the Reformation; but our Preaching hath done more to stop the progress of the Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretism, or of Popery.</hi> Pray what new Reformation was needful after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>James,</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> the I? None that I know of, but the Reformation of 43. and the following years of Reformation, when they reformed <hi>Episcopacy</hi> into <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery,</hi> and <hi>Presbytery</hi> into <hi>Independency,</hi> and a sober <hi>Liturgie</hi> into a <hi>Directory,</hi> or <hi>Enthusiasm,</hi> and 39 <hi>Articles</hi> into all the wild Freaks of <hi>Familism, Anabaptism, Quakerism,</hi> and as many monstrous Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions as were unknown in former Ages, and could scarce be paralleled in <hi>Irenaeus</hi> or <hi>Epiphanius.</hi> And if this were the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, why they did not separate, that they
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:204354:272"/> might accomplish this blessed Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we heartily thank Mr. <hi>B.</hi> both for his Discovery and for his Separation; for we desire to see no more such Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations as these: though what their Preaching does to keep out Popery, I cannot tell; I am sure their Separation helps to bring it in.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Another Reason why they did not separate formerly, and do now, is this, because <hi>few of the most ignorant that nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them, would then have left their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish-Churches to hear non-Conformists in private,</hi> (this was no great Argument of their Ignorance, but that they were good understanding Christians, who knew their duty in preserving Unity and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in Church-Communion) <hi>but now many will come to us that cannot get into Parish-Churches:</hi> If he would have shewn the difference between these two Causes, he should have added the <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi> in the latter part too, which whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be true or no, let him who knows his Hearers best, judge. But the sum is this, they may conform, when they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not get Hearers in schismatical Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, but Conformity is a very ill thing, when they can.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Another difference is <hi>from the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:204354:273"/> of Conformity, as in the Church that we must communicate with:</hi> As 1. <hi>That the Pastors and Vestries of our conforming Churches are a company of perjured Villains,</hi> viz. for renouncing the obligation of an <note place="margin">P. 69.</note> impious Covenant. But is the Dispute about the obligation of the Covenant of greater moment, than about the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law of <hi>Moses?</hi> and yet the Apostle would not allow that a just cause of Separation. 2. That there is no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger any hope of Reformation, since so many bad men are allowed in our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; but were there not bad men in former Ages? and were not the <hi>Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> and <hi>Donatists</hi> to be blamed, who separated upon this account? and do not the old non-Conformists expresly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject this, as a sufficient Reason for Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration?</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Canon now excommunicates,</hi> ipso facto, <hi>all who profess themselves non-Conformists:</hi> but pray what new excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating Canons have been made since the King's Return? or is the excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating non-Conformists a sufficient Reason to justifie non-Conformity?</p>
               <p n="4">4. 2000 <hi>Ministers were not before cast out, which now tempts the People to forsake our Communion:</hi> but great numbers were
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:204354:273"/> before silenced, as they used to complain of old; and the Dispute is not what tempts People to be froward, but what will justifie a Separation: though, I fear, it was not the casting out 2000 Ministers, if that was the number, but the 2000 that were cast out, who drew our Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to Separation.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Formerly, <hi>when one Bishop cast any out, some other usually would endure them; but now it was not so:</hi> This is the great grievance, that there are no Puritanical Bishops in these days, to foster such non-Conformists, who when time serves, would be for plucking up root and branch again. But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> should consider, what has made this Alteration: Those Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions these men brought upon Church and Nation, have convinc'd Bishops, that it is a dangerous thing to cherish such Persons, whose whole design is to poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son People with Fanatical Principles, and to undermine the present Constitution. Some Bishops saw the tendency of their Principles before they outed them; others were taught by dear-bought Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience; and can they blame the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, that they do not take those for such innocent and well-meaning men, who pluckt off their own vizards, and
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:204354:274"/> discover a real Enemy, under the flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring disguise of a meek and humble, but scrupulous and tender-conscienc'd Friend.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Some who do not communicate, nor separate, are tolerated among us; and therefore they had reason to hope, that if they did separate, they should be tolerated, which is the substance of his Argument, too long to transcribe; and a wise one it is: but our Laws or Canons tolerate such men; but Discipline is not duely executed upon the careless or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, and therefore they may separate, as well as not communicate all; and I confess they may; but the neglect of Discipline and Government does neither excuse the sin of those who absent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from our Communion, nor of those who separate: but if this be a new Case, which was in the time of the old non-Conformists, we may see what the blessed effects of a Fanatick Reformation has been.</p>
               <p n="5">5. His last difference between the Case of former and present non-Conformists, is taken <hi>from the things which give them fuller cause for their Preaching and Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,</hi> i. e. that they have more reason now to preach in separate Meetings, than
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:204354:274"/> there was before. He names some; as 1. <hi>We saw the Kingdom, though under Ʋsurpers,</hi> (it is well he will own those to be Usurpers now, whom he did not think so in 59.) <hi>engaged by vow, practice, and about 16 years possession and custom, to another way; and who could expect, that a Law should presently change them all, and assure them of Absolution.</hi> But 1. methinks they might have tryed whether it would or no; but this they durst not trust to, but took all possible courses by Libels and Pamphlets, in their private Talk, and farewel-Sermons, to keep up the old humour, and alienate the minds of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from the established Religion, and then plead that necessity, which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves have made. 2. I hope they will not plead 16 years possession, when no Religion was established, as a sufficient prescription against that, which has been the Religion of this Nation ever since the Reformation. 3. Is Communion with our Church ever the worse, because a potent. Faction and Schism had thrust it out 16 years? 4. Might it not have been as reasonably expected, that People would have returned to the Communion
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:204354:275"/> of the Church, as to their Allegiance to their Prince, though <hi>they had been enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by vow, practice, and about 16 years possession and custom, to another way?</hi> 5. Did this Vow and Covenant oblige them against Conformity to our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, that they needed somewhat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides a Law to assure them of Absoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? 6. Either the People did well in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to their old Vows and Covenants, or they did not: If they did, it is not possession and custom, but the merit of the Cause, which is their justification; if not, how could such conscientious men uphold and countenance People in a bad way, because they had been so long in it? Those who had helpt to bring them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to these ways of Schism, I should have thought, had been more obliged to have helpt them out again: but it is no sign of a very tender conscience, to keep Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in such dangerous mistakes, rather than own a mistake themselves. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever act upon such Principles, value their Credit and Reputation above the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their own or other mens Souls.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another difference is fetcht from
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:204354:275"/> Plague and Fire, which made the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment take less notice of them, and gave them opportunity to poyson the minds of discontented People. This is the old Fanatick way of expounding Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences; they think that lawful to do, which Providence gives them an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of doing: As for the King's Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense, this indeed may excuse them from the sin of Rebellion and Disobedience, in setting up Conventicles, not from the evil of Church-divisions and Separation; but this is a meer pretence, for they kept Conventicles without the King's License both before and since.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Another difference was those Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations they had from the People to preach; but every body knows, that they did not stay for the Peoples Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but first invited them to hear. But however methinks this is but a sorry ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification of Separation, that they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed with the schismatical Inclinations of People, whom they ought to have taught better.</p>
               <p>Thus you see, how this Rule of the Apostle may be applied to our present Controversie, not to break the Peace
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:204354:276"/> and Communion of the Church, for the sake of any different apprehensions of things, which do not immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern Religious Worship.</p>
               <p>But to return to the Argument which occasioned this Digression: Since St. <hi>Paul</hi> was so zealous an Enemy to Separation, and made it so much his business to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> in the same Communion, let who will believe, that he set up such a distinct and separate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of <hi>Gentiles</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> or that <hi>Peter</hi> did of <hi>Jews,</hi> for my part I cannot. When St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote his Epistle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> there was but one Church there, consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> whom he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades to forbear, and to receive one another; nor is there any evidence from Antiquity to make it appear that there were two Churches there; the only thing that has inclined some learned men to favour that Notion, is that difficulty there is in Antiquity, how to order the Successions of the first Bishops in the Church of <hi>Rome; Linus, Clemens, Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Anacletus,</hi> at least if these two last be not the same man, as seems very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. But this was the worst way they
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:204354:276"/> could have taken, when it is so plain, that there was nothing St. <hi>Paul</hi> in all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches did more earnestly endeavour to prevent; an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The result of this whole Discourse is, That to the Communion of a particular Church, it is necessary, that neighbour-Christians meet together for all the Acts of Religious Worship, and that nothing can justifie a Separation from the Church wherein we live, but sinful terms of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; for what Mr. <hi>B.</hi> discourses of occasional Communion, and purer Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions, and such kind of Christians as are members of the Catholick Church, but are not members of any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church, has been considered al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>

               <p>Nor is there any difficulty in explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, what it is to live in Communion with our Bishop, which signifies, to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship God in the Communion of that Church whereof he is Bishop, to obey his Rules and Orders, to reverence his Counsels and Censures, and in all things, which concern the Matters of Religion and Christian Worship, to be subject to his Authority and Directions, while he enjoyns nothing contrary to the Rules of
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:204354:277"/> Scripture, or inconsistent with any part of our duty to God and man.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Another thing wherein Church-Communion consists, and which is an essential part of our Communion with our Bishop, is to live in the Communion only of those <hi>Presbyters,</hi> who live in the Communion of their Bishop, that is, who officiate by his Authority, and are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to his Directions and Orders. This was a standing Rule in <hi>Ignatius</hi> his time, as is evident from his Epistles, That <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi> must do nothing in the Church, but by the Bishop's Consent or Order, and those who do, are Schismaticks, and those People who adhere to them in it, partake in the guilt of their Schisms; such was <hi>Felicissimus,</hi> and those other <hi>Presbyters</hi> of <hi>Carthage,</hi> who broke Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> their Bishop, whom therefore he did excommunicate, and forbad his People to communicate with them, under the pain of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, if they did, and describes their Schism <note place="margin">Cum Episcopo po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="472" facs="tcp:204354:278"/> that is, separating the Sheep from their Pastor, and Children from their Parent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this gives a plain Answer to that Question Mr. <hi>B.</hi> so often asks us, why we cannot communicate with them, as well as they with us; the Resolution of which is very easie, because they do not communicate with their Bishop, and therefore are Schismaticks; they preach without his Authority, and contrary to it, which is to set up Altar against Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar; and though Mr. <hi>B.</hi> sometimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates with our Parish-Churches, that does not excuse him from the guilt of Schism, because he preaches without and in opposition to the Authority of his Bishop, and draws People away from the Communion of the Parish-Churches, which alone are in Communion with their Bishop. Nor can I excuse those Amphibious Christians from Schism, who sometimes go to Church, and sometimes to a Conventicle; for though they are not in a constant state of Schism, as not having wholly forsaken the Communion of their Bishop, yet every time they go
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:204354:278"/> to a Conventicle, they are guilty of a schismatical Act; and had we a St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> among us at this day, they would not be suffered to shift turns thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Church and a Conventicle; for he expresly declared, that those who communicated with <hi>Felicissimus</hi> or <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendus,</hi> his schismatical <hi>Presbyters,</hi> should not be suffered to communicate in the Church with him.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> thinks, it is not the License and Authority of the Bishop, but the Consent of the People, that makes a Church-relation between Pastor and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and then if they can but perswade the People to choose them for their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, the work is done; the one may preach and administer Sacraments, and exercise Discipline, and the other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate in all Religious Offices without Schism; that neither Bishops or <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> are any thing to the People, unless they choose them, or consent to a Church-relation with them, and that all those who are advanced into such Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Offices without the Consent of the People, are no better than Intruders or Usurpers.</p>
               <pb n="474" facs="tcp:204354:279"/>
               <p>This Controversie about the Power of the People in the choice of their Pastors, I confess, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> has managed with more Learning, and a fairere appearance of Reason, than any thing else; but yet has not set things in a true light, nor gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Objections their proper and natural place, which confounds mens minds, and hinders them either from understanding or judging aright what he says. And therefore in Answer to him, I shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce what I have to say under these three Heads: 1. I will at present suppose the Right of the People to choose their own Pastor, and consider whether it will ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie our present Separation. 2. Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what inherent Right they have in the choice of their Pastors. 3. In what cases they ought to insist upon this Right.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let us suppose at present the Right of the People to choose their own Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors. I would only ask, Whether they are not bound to choose their Pastors in the Communion of the Church? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are not still bound to obey the orders and constitutions of the Church, wherein they live, supposing them to be
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:204354:279"/> just and lawful? Whether under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of choosing their own Pastors, they may separate from the Church, and set up distinct Churches and Communions of their own? If Mr. <hi>B.</hi> will not allow this, then notwithstanding the Peoples right of choice and consent, they cannot choose Schismatical Presbyters for their Pastors without being guilty of Schism; and therefore all this dispute about the power of the people is nothing at all to our present controversie of Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>And yet among all those numerous Citations of Authorities out of Ancient Councils, and Fathers, and Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Historians, he cannot produce one Testimomy to give the People right to justifie a Schism by the choice of their Pastors, or to give them power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to a Church-relation with Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Bishops and Presbyters. St. <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> whom Mr. <hi>B.</hi> so often cites for say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that people have the greatest power to choose good Pastors and to refuse the evil, yet condemns those people, who adhered to <hi>Novatianus</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and threatens to Excommunicate those at
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:204354:280"/>
                  <hi>Carthage,</hi> who communicated with <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>issimus</hi> and those other Schismatical Presbyters, who joyned with him: did he now think, that these people had right to choose, where and whom they would to enter into a Church-relation with them: if he did, he did very ill to forbid them, and to threaten Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication against them; if he did not, how would he answer Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s Argument, that every man is nearest to himself, and most concerned in the eternal happiness of his Soul, and therefore ought to judge for himself, who to entrust the care of his Soul with.</p>
               <p>And yet this has been the case of all Church-divisions and Schisms; whoever began them, they have been continued and encreased by the consent of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to take such Schismaticks for their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, and yet I never remember, that this consent to a Church-Relation between the <hi>Novation, Arrian, Donatist,</hi> Bishops and People, was ever thought a justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion either of their Schism or of their He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie; if it were, there never could be any such thing as Schism.</p>
               <pb n="477" facs="tcp:204354:280"/>
               <p>And therefore whatever right may be in the people to choose their Pastors, it cannot excuse them from Schism to break the Communion of the Church wherein they live, and to choose their Pastors out of the Church; to joyn in Communion with those Presbyters, who Separate from the Communion of their Bishop, and set up distinct Churches in opposition to him.</p>
               <p>But it will be said, that this is to grant and to deny in the same breath; to allow People a right of consent in the choice of their Pastors, and yet not to admit of any choice, but where it can't be had: for they cannot choose their own Pastors in the Communion of the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland;</hi> for excepting some few Parochial Churches, who have the right of Patron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age in themselves, all the Bishops and Parish Ministers of <hi>England</hi> are chose by the King, or by Private Patrons; and they do not think themselves concerned to communicate with that Church, which has none or very few Pastors rightly chose, and therefore their Separation is no Schism, but a forming themselves into a Church-Society, which they had not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:204354:281"/> and I hope now, they will not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, that I have not fairly stated their case: and I shall endeavour to give as plain an answer to it, and not offer any thing to others, but what satisfies my self.</p>
               <p n="1">1. And First I would desire them plainly to answer me one question, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be any such thing, as a Christian Church in <hi>England</hi> Establisht by Law, if they answer, there is not, that is, if they are so hardy as to unchurch us, when they give their reasons, I will endeavour to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer them, but I never met any of them yet, that would own such a Principle, nor give the least intimations of it in the most free and familiar converse, where they were in no danger of Laws or Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition; the general complaints are against the terms of our Communion, and there we are willing to joyn issue with them; if then we be a Church notwithstanding this irregular promotion of Bishops and Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, then to separate from us without just reason is a sin, and the irregular choice of Bishops and Presbyters is no just cause, because we are acknowledged to be a true Church notwithstanding this.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="479" facs="tcp:204354:281"/>2. If they are not willing to grant this, that we may be a true Church, and fit to be communicated with, though the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple do not choose their own Bishops and Parish Ministers, it is easie to extort this confession from them, or to put them to the blush. For I would ask them, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose all these impositions they complain of were removed, (I mean those which concern the terms of Communion, such as the Liturgy and Ceremonies) whether it were lawful to joyn in Church-Society with our Parish-Churches, though the King and Private Patrons would not give up their right of Presentations; if they say it were, then it is plain, that the want of Peoples consent in the choice of their Pastors does not unchurch us, nor justifie a Separation, and therefore this is a meer pretence not a true reason of their sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: If they say, that the consent of the People is essentially necessary to the constitution of a Church. Then 1. they unchurch most if not all the Protestant Churches of <hi>Europe,</hi> who have no such choice. 2. They unchurch their dear selves in all the late glorious times, for Patrons would not consent to that piece of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:204354:282"/> to give the disposal of their Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to the choice of the Parishioners, though sometimes, as they do still, they might gratifie some principal Inhabitants with a nomination of a fit Person: And 3. If this be their judgment they would do well to declare it, for unless the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament-men will grant away their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowsons of Livings to the several Parishes, we can have no thorough Reformation to heal our Divisions, but this will be an eternal pretence for Separations, and then the constitution may as well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main as it is, as be altered to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> owns that an after-consent <note place="margin">Second Defence of Non-conf. p. 90.</note> of people to their Bishop or Parish-Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters is sufficient to found a Church-rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and this after-consent is sufficiently manifested by <hi>constant Communion;</hi> let us then by this principle examine whether the Church of <hi>England</hi> be a Church or not.</p>
               <p>If we look back then to the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and King <hi>James,</hi> it is certain it was a Church in those dayes, for whatever antecedent consent they had, the generality of the Nation gave
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:204354:282"/> an after consent to their Bishops and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, the great body of the people even the Puritans themselves for the most part living in Communion with them; thus it continued for the greatest part of King <hi>Charles</hi> the First's Reign, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> himself asserting, that there were very few Non-conformists at the beginning of the War: The Bishops then and Parish Presbyters of those dayes, were the just and rightful Pastors of the Church, not only by a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Title, but by the consent of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who joyned in Communion with them; and therefore those who separated from them, and deposed them, must be Schismaticks; and those who succeeded in their rooms Usurpers; unless they shew some other reason for their Separation than want of the Peoples consent to a Church-relation, or it be in the power of the people, when they please, to choose new Pastors, and depose their old ones, and overturn Church and State, and set up any thing or nothing in the room of it.</p>
               <p>When the King returned, the great body of the People returned to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church, and had continued there to this day, had not some busie Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors for Separation drawn them into a
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:204354:283"/> Snare, and by degrees formed them into a distinct Party and Interest from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Establishment; and yet notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the numerous Sects and Parties, Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Sub-divisions of Fanaticism, I doubt not but much the greatest part of the Nation is still firm to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and live in Communion with it; which proves us in Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s own way to be a Church, and consequently those who separate to choose their own Pastors to be guilty of Schism.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I have one Inquiry more, whether those Presbyters who were ordained in the Church of <hi>England</hi> are not Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, if they separate from the Church without just reason; and whether those who communicate with Schismaticks and choose such for their Pastors, are not Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks: So that it is not enough to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their Separation, to assert the Peoples power in choosing their own Pastors, but they must vindicate their own Innocence, not only as to Nonconformity, but Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; for if they are Schismaticks in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating from that Church, of which they are Presbyters, the People must be Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks in choosing them for their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors; now they cannot deny the Church
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:204354:283"/> of <hi>England</hi> to be a true Church, for then they must renounce their own Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therefore the only way they have to vindicate themselves from the guilt of Schism, is by proving our Church to be so corrupt, that they cannot without sin communicate with it: and thus the controversie returns to its old bottom, the lawfulness or unlawfulness of the terms of our Communion, where we desire to keep it, and from whence Mr. <hi>B.</hi> has with all imaginable arts endeavoured to remove it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us now consider what right the People have of consent to the choice of their Pastors; and here I shall speak with as much care as I can, for fear of falling under Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s lash for want of <hi>Logical strictness,</hi> as the D. does, for whom Mr. <hi>B.</hi> can <note place="margin">Second Defence of Non-conf. p. 126.</note> think of no better Defence than <hi>that he is none of the Disputers of this World, who deceive men with vain Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy;</hi> and I doubt not but the D. will be very well contented to leave that Character to himself, and let him make the best of it: and that all this out-cry about the D's Logick and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy, is for using <hi>power</hi> instead of
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:204354:284"/>
                  <hi>right and liberty,</hi> and yet I am so stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidly Illogical, that I think <hi>the power of consenting</hi> to be the same thing with <hi>the right of consenting;</hi> but <hi>power of consenting in the People, and power in Rulers are not univocal but equivocal terms:</hi> What then: It is power still, and may properly be called power in the People, as well as in the Rulers, though the power be not the same. <hi>But the word (Choice) instead of (Consent) is somewhat more crooked,</hi> which <hi>(crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)</hi> I suppose is a new Logical term: but what is the matter? may not that consent, which alone makes the choice obligatory to the People, be very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called the choice of the People? No, <hi>for (choice) ordinarily includeth the first nominating vote.</hi> In what Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick? a choice is a choice, whoever nominates the persons to be chosen, especially if the people may reject eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that is nominated, till one is nominated in whom they agree and consent: I know not what <hi>Logical strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> this is, but I am sure, it savours of a rude and petulant humour, and an odd kind of composition of Spite, Pride and Pedantry: But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> may spare
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:204354:284"/> his pains, the World knows the Dean of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> too well, to think that he need be taught Logick.</p>
               <p>But to avoid the rebukes of this angry man as well as I can, I will carefully consider what he means by that right of consent the people have in the choice of their Pastors. And he fully explains his sence in Five particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. 1. That the <hi>People are no judges who is fit to be, and shall be a Minister of Christ.</hi> And therefore Bishops and Presbyters may be Ordained without the consent of the people; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may be true Ministers of Christ, whether the people consent to it or not, which I desire may be remembred till a convenient time. 2. <hi>The Supream Civil Governour is the Judge, whom he must countenance maintain and tolerate;</hi> which is another very useful observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 3. <hi>The disposal of the Tythes and Temples is in the power of the Prince and Patron by his grant:</hi> This is a very comfortable observation too, for poor Church of <hi>England</hi> men, who are Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted for being Loyal to their Prince. And yet upon second thoughts, he is unwilling to give up all interest to the
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:204354:285"/> Tythes and Temples. And therefore has several qualifications and limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this power to bring it all back again: For 1. <hi>The Princes Power is not absolute</hi> (over Tythes and Temples) <hi>but under Christ:</hi> That we grant, for we don't make a God of our King—3. <hi>If the Tythes and Temples were given for the Pastors of the Churches, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate is bound to give them to such as are lawfully called to be such Pastors,</hi> i. e. To those who are chose or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to by the People, for he looks upon none others as lawfully called, and therefore adds, <hi>and not by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of his trust overthrow the way of entrance instituted by Christ:</hi> And by having the power of the Tithes and Temples in his hand, he must not deprive the People of their right of consent, by giving the Tythes and Temples to those have not their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, or refusing to give them to those who have: And 4. threatens them with Sacriledge, if they do not: For <hi>if they</hi>

                  <hi>were devoted to God, God is the Propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etor, and it is Sacriledge to alienate them, and an intolerable ill disposal is aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Here he was loth to speak out,
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:204354:285"/> and therefore will not charge them in express words with Sacrilege for dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of them without the Peoples con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, but only <hi>an intolerable ill disposal is alienation;</hi> but what he means any man may guess by what goes before: and speaking of the same business a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after; sayes the D. <hi>confesseth I deny not the Magistrates or Patrons power of their own gift (the case of Sacrilege I leave to their Consciences.)</hi> So that if <note place="margin">Ib. p. 149.</note> they will venture to be Sacrilegious, they may give the Tythes and Temples without the Peoples consent. Is not this now a man of Logick, who has wound themselves into the possession of Tythes and Temples too at the back door of the Peoples consent? For they cannot be disposed of, but to such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons as have the Peoples consent, unless Prince and Patrons will be content to be damned for a Sacrilegious promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Church-men; which is an admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble power he grants to Princes and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons. And thus his former grant to the Civil Magistrate to judge <hi>whom he must countenance, maintain and tolerate,</hi> is quite vanished too; for it is plain he must maintain only those whom the
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:204354:286"/> People consent to receive as Pastors, for they must have the Tythes and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, unless he will commit Sacrilege, and I think this is to <hi>countenance,</hi> and somewhat more than to tolerate them: thus the <hi>right and liberty</hi> of the people, which he will not allow to be called <hi>Power,</hi> to <hi>consent</hi> to the choice, not to choose their Pastors, overtops all the power of Princes, disposes of Tythes and Temples, and gives Laws to the Magistrate whom to maintain and tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and whom not. And yet this he will not allow to be <hi>Pleading the Peoples cause against Magistrates, Patrons and Laws.</hi> And yet I confess I am glad to hear that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> has any sense of Sacrilege, and I hope the godly party will consider it, and never think of fingering Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands again. The 4. §. is much to the same purpose: but 5. he tells us, <hi>I have oft said, that mutual consent is necessary to the being of the relation of Pastor and Flock. And though sometimes the Rulers imposition, and the Patrons choice, may make it the Peoples duty in prudence to consent, when the good preponderates the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ib. p. 127.</note>
                  <hi>hurt (not else) yet till they consent the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is not existent.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="489" facs="tcp:204354:286"/>
               <p>Now before I consider his proofs for the necessity of this consent, it is worth while to consider, how these things hang together, and what an admirable divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion here is of Ecclesiastical power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Prince, the Clergy, and the People. As for the Prince we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready seen how all his power is gone; the people have a Negative Vote against his choice, and if he will not comply with them, they can choose for themselves without his consent, and he has no Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative vote against them, not so much as to the disposal of Tythes and Temples without the danger of Sacrilege.</p>
               <p>The case between the Clergy and the People is somewhat more disputable, for Mr. <hi>B.</hi> owns that <hi>the People are not Judges, who is fit to be, and shall be a Minister of Christ: But the Ordainers and the Person himself conjunct, (i. e.</hi> the person to be Ordained, are the judges of it) <hi>which</hi> (he sayes) <hi>is evident from Scripture in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of all that were ordained. 2. From the nature of the thing:</hi> For <hi>who is suppos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so fit to judge as men and Seniors of the same Office? Who but Physicians are fit to judg, who is meet to be a licensed Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician?
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:204354:287"/> And who but Philosophers judge of Graduates and Professors in Philosophy?</hi> And thus he has in good time given up his Cause, as will appear by some few plain Questions: For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Has a Minister of Christ Authority to preach the Gospel, and to instruct and govern the Church of Christ? If he has not, what does his Ordination signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie? When he has received Authority from Christ, must he wait for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the People? Does not the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Christ command the subjection and consent of the People? For (1.) dare any Christian refuse to be instructed and governed by any Minister, who has received Authority from Christ? Does not Christ tell his Apostles, and in them all the successive Pastors of the Church, <hi>He that refuseth you, refuseth me, and he that refuseth me, refuseth him that sent me?</hi> And what Christian dares refuse Christ in his Ministers and Servants, when they come to them? Will it be owned for a good excuse at the day of Judgment for refusing any Minister, who is set over us in Christ's Name and by his Authority, that we had not given our Consent to a Pastoral Relation to
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:204354:287"/> him? It is very true what Mr. <hi>B.</hi> says, That <hi>it is impossible,</hi> ex naturâ rei, (from the nature of the thing) <hi>that the Pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Office should be exercised upon Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; therefore their Consent is necessary. A Patient may be drencht like a Horse,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ib. p. 139.</note>
                  <hi>and crammed like fatted Fowl, and so may have a Physician against his will, but a soul cannot use Pastoral Helps unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly.</hi> But the Question is, Whether these men are not bound, as they love their souls, and will answer the Affront they put upon the Authority of Christ in his Ministers, willingly and chearfully to submit to Pastoral Conduct and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, <hi>to obey those who are set over them in the Lord;</hi> whether the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of conscience and sense of duty ought not to cure a capricious humour? For it is too late to dispute the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a publick Minister of Religion, when he has received Authority from Christ, which he may exercise over any part of the Christian Church, where ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Invitations of the People, or the Power of the Magistrate shall place him. And I would desire Mr. <hi>B.</hi> to shew me any one instance in Scripture, where the Consent of the People was required in setting over them any Bishop or <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter,</hi>
                  <pb n="492" facs="tcp:204354:288"/> who was already ordained. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is alledged for their Consent at Ordinations, as their presence at the choice of an Apostle to succeed in the room of <hi>Judas,</hi> and the choice of Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, though not much to the purpose, and as we must conclude from Mr. <hi>B.</hi> nothing at all to the purpose, <hi>that there is no Scripture-instance (of the Peoples being Judge, who is fit to be, and shall be a Minister of Christ) in all that were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus it was in the Ages succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Apostles, the great care and interest of People was at Ordinations; for when once they were ordained, there was no resisting their Authority, unless they were canonically deposed.</p>
               <p>This is evident in the Ordination of <hi>Presbyters</hi> and Readers, to whose Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination the Consent of the People was usually asked; though sometimes it was done without, as we find in St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who ordained some while he was under Banishment, absent from his Church, and gives an account to them by Letter, what he had done. But when they were ordained, they were imployed by the Bishop for the administration of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Offices, without asking any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leave of the People.</p>
               <pb n="493" facs="tcp:204354:288"/>
               <p>Thus we know that Bishops were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ordained but to some Church, and the Canons expresly provide against the translation of Bishops from one Church to another, and it was but very rarely practised in ancient times; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the Episcopal Chair was emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by the death of the Bishop, the great contest was to choose a Bishop to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to that vacant Church. This Mr. <hi>B.</hi> will find to be true in most of those Examples and Canons which he himself has produced.</p>
               <p>There is one Canon indeed he quotes, <note place="margin">Concil. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> c. 18.</note> which the D. had quoted before, of the Council of <hi>Antioch;</hi> which supposes, that when the Bishop is ordained for any Church without the Consent of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they did sometimes refuse him; the words as Mr. B. translates them are these: That if one be ordained Bishop, and go not to the Parish, (but for all his tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slating it <hi>Parish,</hi> the Council does not speak of Mr. B's. <hi>Parochial Bishop) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the People refuse him, he shall have</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Second Def. of non-Conf. p. 141.</note>
                  <hi>the Honour and Office of a Bishop, not troubling the peace of the Church; which</hi> (as Mr. B. adds) <hi>plainly saith, what I have oft said, that the People have no power to hinder any from being Ministers
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:204354:289"/> or Bishops indefinitely in the universal Church, but only to judge whether he shall be theirs, whereas the Ordainers had power in both Cases.</hi> But where does this Canon say any such thing? It seems to me, as the D. said, to suppose the quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that the Bishops who were the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainers, did not believe that the People had any inherent Right any more to choose their own Bishop, than to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain; for they did ordain the refused Bishop <hi>indefinitely in the universal Church,</hi> but ordained him to that particular Church, where the People refused him; which necessarily supposes, that they did think they had Authority to do so, (what-ever Custom sometimes prevailed against it) without asking the Peoples Consent, or else they would never have attempted it; and therefore that provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion they make for him to retain the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Office of a Bishop, though his People should refuse him, does not sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that of Right they might do so, but was a prudent provision to prevent for the future such Disorders and Troubles in the Church, as probably had happened formerly upon such occasions.</p>
               <pb n="497" facs="tcp:204354:289"/>
               <p>I doubt not but Mr. <hi>B.</hi> very well saw the truth of what I have now discoursed, but was very unwilling to make the peoples consent necessary to the ordination of a Bishop, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to found a pastoral relation, for he was sensible, that people could have no further interest in ordinations, than to be judges of his holy and blameless conversation, as the Dr. had asserted, <hi>that the main ground of the peoples interest was founded upon the Apostles Canon, that a Bishop must be blameless, and of good report.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as where he can produce any one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance where people chuse a Bishop who was a Bishop before, there are sorty on the other side; and therefore their business was to chuse a Bishop to be ordained for them, and therefore could have no greater interest in the choice, than they had in the ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Bishop, which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> says was none, but I acknowledge to be as much as their good testimony of his life and manners, and of his faithful discharge of any inferiour office in the Church.</p>
               <p>And I have an unanswerable argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove, that this was the only interest they had (whatever they
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:204354:290"/> usurped by tumults and disorders) in the choice of a Bishop, and that their consent was not originally required to a Pastoral relation, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> founds it, and that is this, that there is no greater right assigned to them, in all antiquity in the choice of a Bishop, than they had in the choice of Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons and Presbyters; they used indeed ordinarily to concern themselves more in this, because they thought it a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of greater consequence, but the original right was the same; as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the Scripture instance of the choice of Deacons, whereon most men found the right of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and from the universal practice of the Church in <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s and St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s days, when Deacons, Readers, Presbyters, and all other Church-officers were as much chosen by the people, and by the fame right, that the Bishops were, and <hi>Tertullian</hi> expresly tells us, what the choice of Bishops and Presbyters was in those days, whom he calls by the common name of <hi>Seniores, honorem istum non pretio sed testimonio adepti, they obtained this honour not by purchase, but by testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:</hi> that good report, which the people,
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:204354:290"/> who knew their lives and conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, gave of them.</p>
               <p>Now the interest of people in the choice of Deacons and Presbyters, could not be founded on the necessity of their consent in a Pastoral relation: the case is plain in Deacons, who were no Pastors, and yet ought no more to be made without the consent of the people than the Bishop; and in those first ages of the Church, Presbyters were never looked on as their Pastors (which name and office was peculiar to the Bishop) but as subordinate Ministers, who were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in such religious offices, as the Bishop pleased: the Bishops Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish or Diocess was not then divided into distinct Titles or Parishes, with their fix't Presbyters over them, which looks more like a Pastoral rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but the whole Diocess lay in common, though there were several congregations in it for religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, as I think has been proved above, and the Bishop allotted his Presbyters their work and Province, as he saw the necessities of the Church require. Now if the consent of the people be founded only in a Pastoral relation,
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:204354:291"/> what gave them a right of consent in the Election of Presbyters and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons? the practice of the Church was the same in all, without the least no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice taken of any different or greater interest the people had in the choice of their Bishop, than of any meaner Church-officers, the consent of the people to a Pastoral relation, being of no elder date than the rise of Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, and never mentioned in all the writings of the ancient Fathers, as far as I can observe either in my own read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or what more learned men have collected from them.</p>
               <p>Before I examine Mr. B.'s reasons to prove the necessity of the peoples consent to constitute a Pastoral relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I shall urge one argument against it; which is this. All the true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Christ, and Pastors of his Flock are Ministers of the Catholick Church, and have a Pastoral relation to the whole Church, and all Christian peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are members of the Catholick Church, and are related to all the Pastors of it, which cannot possibly be owing to consent between Pastor and people. Every Christian Pastor is qualified for the exercise of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storal
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:204354:291"/> office in any part of the world, and is bound to it, as he has opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to do it: Every Christian man is bound to communicate with all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Churches in the world, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing nothing sinful in their communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to obey their Pastors, while he lives among them, though he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver gave any consent to this Pastoral relation, but by consenting to become a Christian, and to submit to that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which Christ has placed in his Church. I need not insist on this, which I have abundantly proved in what I have already discourst about the unity and communion of the Catholick Church, and if that hold good, as I shall conclude it does, till I see it fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confuted, there can be no place for such a consent, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> or such a particular-Church-Covenant, as Dr. O. calls it, to found a Pastoral rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between Pastor and people. Christ who founded his Church hath set his Ministers over it, to instruct and govern his Church in his name, and by his authority, and whoever will be a Christian must submit to the authority of Christ, as visibly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised by his Ministers, which makes
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:204354:292"/> a Catholick relation between all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors and Christian people; and as for a relation to a particular Church, private Christians are determined by the place of their habitation, if there be any Christian Church there; and a Bishop or Presbyter may be fixt in a particular Church, by the choice of the Prince, Clergy, or people, or by all together, as the Laws of any particular or national Church determine; and though it might be thought convenient in some cases, that the people were consulted in the choice, yet it cannot be necessary to a Pastoral relation, and so is not void and null without it: for we have a relation to all the Ministers of Christ antecedent to the notion of a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church and particular communion, and therefore cannot refuse obedience to him that is set over us in particular, though without our consent, if he be a true Minister of Christ.</p>
               <p>I proceed now to examine Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s proofs for the necessity of the peoples consent to the choice of their Bishop or Pastor, to found a Pastoral relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and he argues from the universal practice of the Church, and from the
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:204354:292"/> nature of the thing. I mightily love arguments from the nature of things, which when rightly deduced, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways most plain and convincing; and therefore I shall begin my enquiry here, and do profess my self very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <note place="margin">Second Def. of Nonconf. <hi>p.</hi> 133.</note> to learn, and therefore am not afraid, <hi>that more light should put out my eyes,</hi> as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> suspects some of his Adversaries are; but if there be any such men, I would have them take courage, and venture their eyes, for Mr. B. is a very merciful man to his Readers upon this account, if they do not lose their eyes in fogs and mists, he will never put them out with too much light.</p>
               <p>He never indeed wants twenty ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments for any thing, and such a kind of number he has given us here, but I can make but three or four at most of them. 1. That every man has a propriety in his own soul, and is more concerned to take care of it, than any one else, and therefore must chuse his own Pastor, to whom he will commit the care of his Soul. 2. From the necessity of the Pastoral office, and the faithful discharge of it. 3. That it is very unlikely, Princes
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:204354:293"/> and Pastors should chuse so well for people, as they will for themselves. 4. That no pretence of publick good and order can dispense with this duty of taking care of our Souls. This is the force of all he says, so far as I can understand it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The first he very industriously endeavours to prove, though I think no man ever denied, that we ought to take care of our souls, though the consequence be somewhat doubtful, of which more anon. But in his proof of this we are furnished with such ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Politicks and Aphorisms for a Holy Commonwealth, as I fear will be found to overthrow all Civil as well as Ecclesiastical power. Thus in his first proposition he tells us, <hi>propriety is in order of nature antecedent to Regiment</hi> (or Government) which supposeth it, and is to order the use of it for <hi>common safety and good.</hi> But now he ought to have exercised his distinguishing faculty here, and told us what <hi>propriety</hi> he means, whether that propriety which every man has in himself, or that propriety which governours have in their Subjects: That propriety which Governours
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:204354:293"/> have in their Subjects is the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Government: Thus God has a right to govern the world because he made it: this made <hi>Adam</hi> an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Monarch over his own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; which power descended to the Heads of Families, reserving some au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to immediate Parents, and thus it was ordered by God himself in the Jewish State: The Princes of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> being the heads of their Tribes and Families; and thus propriety is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Government still, not indeed a natural but acquired propriety, either by Conquest, Descent, or Election.</p>
               <p>But if he means every mans pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in himself, it makes every man an absolute Prince in his own concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and so he adds 4. <hi>self-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (as to power and obligation) is antecedent to humane publick government in order of nature, that is, has a more immutable right, which publick govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment does not destroy, but regulate. 6. Parents government is antecedent to Princes, and Princes cannot take it from them, nor disoblige their children, but self-government is more natural than Parents, and Parents and Princes must help it, but not destroy it:</hi> the Parent
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:204354:294"/> has more power over his children than the Prince, and a Child more power than his Parent; and thus every pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate man is the absolute governour of himself, by the law of nature.</p>
               <p>But not to examine now the loose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of these principles, nor what ill influence they may have upon civil government, especially upon an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary Monarchy (for I cannot see any reason why upon these principles, the people have not an inherent and immutable right to chuse their King, as well as their Bishop) I will readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grant, that every man has a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er right to his own soul than either Prince or Bishop, and is more nearly concerned to take care of it; but I do not see how Mr. B. proves from hence that every man has an inherent and unalterable right to chuse his own Pastor; indeed he does not offer one word of proof for it that I see, but takes it for so plain a consequence as needs no proof; and therefore I shall only of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a reason or two to shew, that this consequence is not so plain and certain.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because mankind always had an equal right in their souls, that they have at this day, and yet this was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:204354:294"/> allowed them under any religion to chuse their own Priests and Pastors. Before the Law, as is generally belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the Priesthood was annexed to the head of the Family, as the civil power was; under the Law God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self confined the Priesthood to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular family and tribe: The family of <hi>Aaron</hi> and the tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> were separated for the service of the Altar and the Temple, and all the Ministers of Religion; and therefore in those days the people were denied the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of choice, though the Priests were never so ignorant and vicious, as it is plain they were in several ages of the Jewish Church. And when our Saviour himself came into the world, though he warned his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples against the leaven of the Scribes and Pharisees, yet he did not allow them to withdraw from their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and to chuse better for themselves, but on the other hand tells them, <hi>the Scribes and Pharisees sit</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Math. 23. 2, 3.</note>
                  <hi>in</hi> Moses'<hi>s seat, all therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do, but do not ye after their works, for they say, and do not.</hi> And when our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our himself instituted a Church he
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:204354:295"/> chose his Apostles himself, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands all to hear them; and the Apostles followed this example, and by that authority they received from Christ, ordained others to succeed in their room, without the choice of the people (as Mr. B. himself acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges) and yet commands all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians to be subject to them, as the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of Christ; which was to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Pastors on them without their consent either antecedent or conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, any otherwise than as they knew themselves obliged chearfully to consent to such Pastors as were set over them by the Apostles, to whom the power belonged.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Men who are so sensible of the worth of their souls, as this argument supposes, may take very great care of them, especially in such a Church, and such an age as this, without sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating from the communion of the Church, though his Parish Minister be none of the best preachers, nor best and wisest men: In the daily appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed service of the Church they have the Scriptures read to them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout pious prayers in a language which they understand, and if it were
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:204354:295"/> no more, a man may provide very well for his soul by a diligent read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or hearing the Scriptures read to them, and whatever men say, it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues no great opinion of the suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of the Scriptures, to speak so meanly of the ordinary service of the Church, wherein the Scriptures are daily read, and the principal doctrines of faith piously and judiciously explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Catechism and homilies of the Church, as if people, who had no more, were in such a deplorable and desperate state for their souls. Which yet was thought a singular blessing at the beginning of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and would be so still did men either understand, what kind of preaching the Church has had in most ages, or took not more pleasure in gratifying a wanton curiosity, and itching ears, than in saving their souls: but besides, how many pious books are all men furnished with who are desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of saving knowledge? how many knowing Christians are there in most neighbourhoods, who, as Mr. B. says, are capable of giving very wholsome advice and counsel, and might make as good preachers as most of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:204354:296"/> Primitive Fathers? How many learned, judicious, and pious Pastors are there in all parts of the Countrey, to whom they may privately resort in difficult cases for resolution, and make their private particular guides, when their own Parish Minister is not fit for that office? and a man who takes care of his soul, will rather chuse upon such occasions to ride or walk some miles, than to break the communion of the Church.</p>
               <p>So that all serious Christians, who love and take care of their souls, may provide very well for them in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this liberty of chusing their own Pastor, when they do not like him who is set over them by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Church and State: and therefore that care which men ought to take of their souls, and that right they have in them, does not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily prove the necessity of their own consent to a Pastoral relation.</p>
               <p>And as for other men, who take no care of their souls, I suppose Mr. B. does not so earnestly plead for their liberty of choice, which is not like to be a very good one; since, as Mr. B.
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:204354:296"/> says, <hi>it is natural, to generate the like, and for men to do, and chuse as they</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ib. p.</hi> 135.</note>
                  <hi>are, and as their Interest leads them:</hi> And if this be an argument against the choice of Princes and Patrons, I think it is no good argument for the choice of a vicious people.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If that right men have to take care of their souls, be a good argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove their right to chuse their Pastors, methinks it proves some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more than Mr. B. will own, that they ought to consent to the choice, or have as much right in the choice of those persons, who are to be ordained Pastors, as in chusing, who shall be their particular Pastors. My reason is this, because if there be any error com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, the fundamental error is in ordaining unfit and unqualified Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors; for since the people, as Mr. B. sayes, must chuse an ordained Pastor, if none were ordained but those, who are fit, they could never make an ill choice; nor were there such great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to be curious about it; and if any unfit persons be ordained, they must fall to some bodies share, unless we will suppose more to be ordained, than there is any need of; which though
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:204354:297"/> I grant is often done, yet is contrary to Primitive practice, and both the Ancient and Modern Canons of the Church, which will not allow Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, but to some Church or Title. And let us make a wild supposition for once, as Mr. B. makes many, when his cause requires it: suppose the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainers should be so generally cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt in Faith or Manners themselves as to ordain none, or very few men duely qualified for the Pastoral Office, what would become of the peoples choice then? How would they take care of their souls, when there are none to chuse, who are fit to take care of them? And yet Mr. B. will not allow them any choice or consent, who shall be Ministers of Christ, but only who shall be theirs, which it is plain, is not a sufficient security to their souls, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less wise, and good, and faithful men are first ordained as objects of their choice.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That reason Mr. <hi>B.</hi> assigns against their right and interest of choice and <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ib. p.</hi> 126.</note> consent, <hi>who is fit, and shall be a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of Christ,</hi> is to the full as good a reason against their choice of their own Pastor, notwithstanding their
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:204354:297"/> right to take care of their souls. For if none <hi>be so fit to judge</hi> (of the fitness of men to be Ordained) <hi>as men and Seniors of the same Office, as Physicians are fit to judge, who is meet to be a Licensed Physician,</hi> then certainly those who are fittest to judge, who shall be a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, are fittest also to judge, to what people they shall discharge that Office. For the care of our souls (as far as concerns this matter) only requires us to chuse a Person fit to discharge a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storal Office; and therefore those, who are best able to judge of fitness for the Pastoral Office, are the most compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Judges, of such a choice too; and people take the best care of their souls, by committing the choice to better Judges than themselves.</p>
               <p n="5">5. There is as much hazard to the souls of men in the choice of their own Pastors, as in any other way. People who are careless of Religion, will make as careless a choice too; those who are giddy, will be fickle and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant to any, and soon repent of their choice, and either depose their Pastor, if that liberty also be granted, or not regard him, which makes that relation useless. Those who are erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous,
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:204354:298"/> will chuse a Pastor of their own mind, who shall not correct, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm their errors; and those who are injudicious and ignorant, which I doubt is the case of many, who are thought very knowing Christians, will chuse a man of noise and passion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the most grave and experienced Divine; and some men of better judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or who are over-ruled by wise men, will make a wise choice: but all that I conclude from hence is, that the choice of the people, is not the best way to take care of their souls, and therefore we have no reason to think, that our Saviour appointed this way.</p>
               <p n="6">6. There are other Persons accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God for peoples souls, as well as themselves, I mean the Governours of Church and State; and if the choice of fit Pastors be of such mighty conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence as indeed it is, they certainly ought to have the over-ruling power in this matter; for they are accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God as Governours, which sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, that they have a superiour Power and Government; and yet if the people have a Negative Voice, that no man can be their Pastor without
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:204354:298"/> their consent, there are infinite cases wherein Governours have no authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at all to take care of them. And as people have a right in their souls, so I suppose Governours have in theirs, and yet they forfeit their own souls, by not taking care of the peoples. And as for what Mr. <hi>B.</hi> urges, that <hi>the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ib. p. 134.</note>
                  <hi>gain or loss is more the Patients; than the Imposers: it is their own souls, that are like to be profited and saved by need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful helps, or lost for want of them, and therefore it most concerns themselves to know what helps they chuse.</hi> It is not upon all accounts true: For the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates and Imposers soul is as much concerned as theirs, nay, he is to give an account for all those souls, which suffer through his neglect, but they are to account only every man for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; and he is less excusable, if he do not exercise that power he has to save men even against their wills; than private men are for not making greater improvements, when they wanted better helps, which they could not have without disturbing publick Peace and Order: though every man is most concerned to take care of his soul, yet he has no right to damn his
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:204354:299"/> soul, though he shall be the greatest sufferer by it, which yet is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est force of Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s argument, for if a man have not right to damn his soul, he has not the greatest right to chuse his own Pastor, because it is as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible he may make a bad as a good choice, and those Governours who are concerned to use their power and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest to prevent mens damning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and are accountable to God, if they do not; have certainly power power to govern and over-rule people in the choice of their Pastors, and to make good provision for them against their wills, which destroyes their inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and unalterable right of choice.</p>
               <p n="7">7. I would desire Mr. <hi>B.</hi> to consider, whether it is likely, that God who is the God of Peace and Order, should appoint such a way of choice, as in the very nature of it, considering the state of mankind in this world, must inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably break the Church into ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand factions: For by Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, every single man is to chuse for himself, and must no more be over-ruled by a Majority of Votes in such an Election, than be imposed on by King, Bishops, or Patrons: for every
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:204354:299"/> man is nearest to himself, and most concerned for his own soul: and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> expresly owns, that though the <note place="margin">Ib. p. 90.</note> person be chose by the major part of the people of any Church, and reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by some few odd persons, he is by this means, <hi>the Churches Pastor, but not the refusers:</hi> and upon these princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples it is almost impossible there ever should be a popular Election without dividing the Church; for it is next an impossibility, that five hundred Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, suppose, which make no large Church, should every man consent in the same Persons. I am sure it was otherwise in Dr. <hi>Seaman</hi>'s Church, which as I am informed had not above thirty Electors, and yet after Prayer, and Fasting, and Sermons to direct them in their choice, they divided into two Churches, and chose two distinct Pastors; and so they may do every Week if they please, according to these principles, till every two or three of them make a Church by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His next head of arguments is from the necessity of the Pastoral Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and the faithful discharge of it. Thus <hi>Prop.</hi> 12. he tells us, <hi>Scripture
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:204354:300"/> and experience tells us, that God worketh</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Second <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>usually according to the aptitude of means and instruments; and learned experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Physicians cure more than the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, rash and slothful; and good Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars make their Pulpits more learned, than the ignorant do; and skilful, able, experienced, holy Pastors convert and edifie much more than ignorant and vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men. And means must accordingly be chosen. 13. If the Pastoral work skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and faithfully done, be needful, it must not be neglected, whoever forbid it. If it be not needful, what is the Church of</hi> England <hi>good for, more than Infidels, or at least than</hi> Moscovites? <hi>and for what are they maintained with Tythes, Glebe, and all the Dignities, and Honours, and Wealth they have? and for what do men so much contend for them?</hi> If I knew what needed answer in this, I think it were no hard matter to answer it. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Who denyes the necessity of the Pastoral Office? But cannot there be Wise, Learned, Skilful, Experienced Pastors, unless the people chuse them? Are there none such but among Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks? and are none fit to chuse them but Schismaticks? are such gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:204354:300"/> people the only fit persons to chuse skilful, experienced and holy Pastors?</p>
               <p n="2">2. What does the dispute of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in opposition to the Authority of Church and State, signifie to the choice of the people? unless he thinks people ought to chuse none but those, whom their Governours refuse. But are those likely to be the most skilful, holy Pastors, who make a Schism themselves, and draw people into it? I pray God forgive the giddiness and folly of such people, who by the insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of such Preachers involve themselves in the guilt of a damning sin.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What occasion was there for those scurrilous reflections upon the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as little better than <hi>Infidels</hi> or <hi>Moscovites,</hi> and unworthy to be maintained by Tythes, and Glebe, and Honours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For does the Church of <hi>England</hi> cry down the Pastoral Office as needless? Is there any Church in the World, which so abounds with learned, skilful and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Pastors? But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and others of his faction, who pretend so much to despise Tythes, and Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Honour, by those frequent
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:204354:301"/> flurts at Church-preferments, and the wealth of Church-men, which I can assure him, excepting some few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, is not great, plainly shew, what is the object of their envy, and that they have as much mind to the Tythes and Temples as to the people, unless they can command their Purses too, which many of them have great skill in.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The substance of his third argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, that it is very unlikely, that Princes and Patrons should chuse so well for the people, as they will them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. This he manages in <hi>Proposition</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ib. p. 135.</note> or <hi>Argument</hi> 14. (for I know not well what to call it) and proves it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>it is hard for a rich man to be saved, and few of them prove good: that the Clergy themselves do not say, that all the Patrons in</hi> England <hi>are wise and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; many Parliaments have by our Church men been deeply accused, and most Parliament-men I think are Patrons: others say, most Patrons not chosen to Parliaments, are worse: some Preachers complain of great men for fornication, drunkenness, excess, idleness, yea, Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism and Infidelity: If many or any be such, are they likely to chuse such Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:204354:301"/> as all godly men may trust in so great a case? or would not such Princes chuse such Bishops?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here Mr. B. has forgot his good rule, and shews that he was not in earnest, when he said it, but spoke it in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and drollery, that our present Dissenters are the <hi>generality of the most religious and sober people of the Land</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Treatise of Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, <hi>p.</hi> 168.</note>
                  <hi>(alwayes excepting the King and Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and those that must be still excepted.)</hi> It is a mighty priviledge Schismaticks have, to be witty above other men; for the Cause of God sanctifies the boldest reflections upon all Superiours in Church or State.</p>
               <p>But his argument is this, most Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons are bad men, and therefore will chuse Pastors like themselves: 1. This is matter of fact, and confuted by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience; either most Patrons are not bad men, or those who are bad may make a good choice; for there never was a better Clergy in <hi>England</hi> than is at this day, nor less need of their rude clamours.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I fear the generality of people are as bad as Patrons, and therefore as likely to make as bad a choice, and then there is no remedy but the godly
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:204354:302"/> people must be Schismaticks, and chuse for themselves, unless they can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade these ungodly people who go to Church, to let the Saints chuse for them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It does not alwayes follow, that a bad man will chuse a bad Minister: many who are very wicked themselvs, will not allow their Children to be so, and of all things abhor a vicious Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy-man: and their interest may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige them to gratifie their Neighbours or Tenants, or some powerful Interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor. Mr. B. mightily mistakes man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, if he imagine that every bad man thinks himself concerned to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate Vice. And here I have Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s authority for it, who tells us, that <hi>it is known by experience, that learning and great worth doth as light so reveal it self to humane nature, that usually most of those, who are loth to be holy themselves, would have a Saint and an able man.</hi> The danger of such choices is not so much meerly from men, who are vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous themselves, as from Atheists, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists or Fanaticks, who if they can meet with any such Persons as are likely to prove a scandal to the Church and to Religion, too often prefer them
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:204354:302"/> before the most learned, pious and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Pastors.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Though Princes may be very bad themselves, it is so much their Civil interest, to have a sober and learned Clergy, to keep people in good order and government, that we have little reason to suspect, that they will lay a design to propagate Vice and Irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which is the most likely way to undermine their own Thrones. So that there is more probability that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons and Princes, though bad them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, should make good provision of able Pastors, than that a wild, giddy, factious people should.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Another thing he insinuates not as a direct argument, but to prevent objections: for he could not but be sensible, that that extravagant power he allowed the people, would disturb all good order and government in the Church, and expose it to perpetual Factions and Schisms: and therefore he rejects the pretence of publick <note place="margin">Second Def. of Non-conf. <hi>p.</hi> 133.</note> good, and publick government as of no consideration in this matter. He argues from that care all men must take to please God and save their souls, to prove that right they have to
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:204354:303"/> chuse their own Pastors, and sayes, <hi>the obligation to please God, and obtain salvation, and escape Sin and Hell</hi> (and consequently in order to this, to chuse their own Pastors, for to that end it is alledged) <hi>is so great, that no man is to pretend publick good, or the will of man against it: and self-government (as to power and obligation is antecedent to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane publick government in order of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: and publick government doth not destroy it, but regulate it; and therefore is not for destruction, but edification. The end of self-government is so much to please God, and save our souls, that no man can on pretence of humane govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment disoblige us from it.</hi> All this is to prove the unalterable right of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the choice of their Pastors, and if he had stated the case so, every body would have startled at it, that men are bound not to quit their right in the choice of their Pastor, though it might be for the publick good of the Church, and for the peace and order of publick government; and therefore he chuses to lay the stress upon pleasing God; and saving their souls; <hi>that no man is to pretend publick good and the will of man against this;</hi> nor did any man ever
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:204354:303"/> pretend this, that I know of: but the question is, whether the right of chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing their own Pastors be so necessary to please God and to save their souls, that no consideration of publick good and publick government, no regard to the peace of the Church, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to our Prince, should make it our duty to dispense with it: for what he speaks here in general of pleasing God, and saving our souls, must be restrained to the thing he was to prove, if it be any thing to his purpose, and so it ought to be explained in these words, that <hi>the obligation to chuse our own Pastors in order to please God and obtain salvation, and escape sin and Hell, is so great, that no man is to pretend pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good, or the will of man against it;</hi> a proposition which I suppose he will not care to stand to, when he cannot take Sanctuary in general terms; for as any man with half an eye may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover in his Answer to the <hi>Dean,</hi> this is Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s way to make wild and lewd suppositions, and to speak in loose and general terms, and if he be charged with that sense, which the design and series of his discourse requires, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes the charge, and rather chuses to
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:204354:304"/> be thought impertinent in his answers, than to own what he cannot defend.</p>
               <p>This is the substance of all his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning, to prove the right of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to chuse their own Pastors, unless any should think there were any force in a comparison or two, which he takes I perceive for parallel cases, and alwayes uses in this argument; that every man has liberty to chuse his Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician and his Wife; and that a Prince cannot impose a Physician on them, <hi>who they believe is like to kill them by ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, error, or treachery,</hi> &amp;c. Mr. B. repeats this so often, as if he thought there were great weight in it, and yet the distance is as wide as between a private concern, and publick govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Prince is not intrusted with mens private concernments, any otherwise than as they have an influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon publick government, but the care of the Church and of Religion is as much his charge and Province, as any other part of government; Schisms in the Church are destructive to Religion and the souls of men, and very often occasion factions in the State, and threaten the publick peace; and yet if every Subject has such an
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:204354:304"/> uncontroulable power of chusing his Pastor, it is impossible ever to see an end of divisions, while they entertain different opinions, and pass such diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent judgements upon men and things. And whereas Mr. B. thinks the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test security consists in a great many negative Votes, that Prince, Patrons, Bishops, people should each of them be able to make void an Election, I confess I see no other security in it, but that there never shall be a choice with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Schism; for though it were pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, that the Prince or Patron, and Bishop, and majority of people should agree, this does not oblige the refusers, who may if they please sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate into a distinct Church under a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor of their own.</p>
               <p>Having thus examined his reasons for the peoples right of choice, consent or refusal (call it which you will, for it comes much to one) of their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Pastors, let us now briefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the historical account he has given of the practice of the Church in this matter. I have not now either time or Books at hand to examine his particular testimonies, but shall make some such general remarks, as may be
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:204354:305"/> sufficient for this purpose.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I observe, that neither in his <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer</hi> to the <hi>Dean,</hi> nor in his <hi>Plea for Peace,</hi> he has urged one Scripture pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept or example for such a choice, <note place="margin">Second Def. of Non-conf. <hi>p.</hi> 136.</note> though the <hi>Dean</hi> had particularly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered those places, which are usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alledged for it, which he passes over without any notice. He quotes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed some places of Scripture, but to what purpose I cannot tell, surely not to prove the peoples right to chuse their Pastors, such are these, <hi>Take heed how ye hear,</hi> which may be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out chusing their Pastors, and the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it will prevent any danger form them, whom they do not chuse: <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of false Prophets,</hi> but Prophets whether true or false, were never chose by the people; <hi>and their leaven,</hi> he should have said <hi>the leaven of the Scribes and Pharisees,</hi> who were no fixt Pastors neither in Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s sense, nor chose by the people, much less by Christs Disciples, who yet were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to hear them, but to beware of their leaven; and let them serve the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but as Christ commanded his Disciples to serve the Pharisees, to hear them, but to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:204354:305"/> of any corrupt Doctrines they taught, and we will not quarrel with them. <hi>Beware of the concision,</hi> that is, the Jewish Separatists, who would not communicate with the Gentiles: <hi>A man that is an heretick avoid;</hi> a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand given to a Bishop, not to the people: and though the peoples duty, when the heresie is notorious, yet it does not prove their right to chuse their Pastors. <hi>Let no man deceive you:</hi> so we say also, and yet think not a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular election of Pastors necessary; <hi>Those that cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine ye have learned avoid—from such turn away:</hi> that is, from all Schismaticks; thus we teach our people, and for this Mr. B. and others are so angry with the <hi>Dean.</hi> Mr. B. I confess has a greater reach than other men, and so he had need to have, who can find out the peoples right to chuse their Pastors in such Texts as these.</p>
               <p>I would enquire then of him, since he has no Scripture proof of this, how he finds a Divine authority for it, or if he have no Divine authority, how he dares set it up in opposition to publick Laws and Constitutions to all the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:204354:306"/> of Church and State, as a right unalterable by any humane power.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As for his later authorities out of Councils and Fathers, I would desire to know under what notion he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges them: whether as witnesses of the Apostolical practice, or as a binding authority to all the succeeding Ages of the Church. The second I presume he will not own, but if he own the first, he must allow them to be very good witnesses in other matters of fact as well as this: and then the dispute about Diocesan Episcopacy, and the right of Patriarchs and Metropolitans is out of doors, which are expresly confirmed by the first <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, to whose authority he appeals in this matter. But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> has a refuge and distinction at hand in these cases: what he likes, is Apostolical practice; what he does not, is decreed by humane wisdom: as he distinguishes in the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council called <hi>Quinosextum,</hi> where he finds one Decree, as he thinks, for the peoples election, and this is very well; but <hi>the same Council by humane wisdom decreed,</hi> Can. 38. <hi>That whatsoever alteration the Imperial power maketh on any City, the Ecclesiastical
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:204354:306"/> order follow it: Which,</hi> he says, <hi>is the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Second Def. of Nonconf. <hi>p.</hi> 129.</note>
                  <hi>way by which humane order overthrew di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine order and institutions:</hi> he means his Parochial Episcopacy; and yet these are both matters of fact which they were equally capable of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and testifying, and therefore their authority is good in both or in neither; and there is more to be said even from the Apostolical age, for this order of planting Churches than for popular Elections.</p>
               <p>But we have an admirable instance of his partiality to his cause in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Nicene</hi> Council; when he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges it for himself, he says, <hi>though by servility they were for images, yet they</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Second Defence of Nonconf. <hi>p.</hi> 131.</note>
                  <hi>held to the old Church Canons for Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,</hi> and thus far their authority is very good. When the <hi>Dean</hi> a little after produces a testimony out of the same Council against him: He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers, <hi>Had this been true, it would not much move me, that these two Councils</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 143.</note>
                  <hi>that set up Image-worship, and shewed much wickedness, should contradict the Apostolical and Catholick practice and constitutions.</hi> So different a case is it to speak for or against Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s darling opinions.</p>

                  <pb n="532" facs="tcp:204354:307"/>3. I observe most of his authorities are of a very late date: in his answer to the <hi>Dean</hi> he begins with the first <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, which was in the fourth Century; and though he tells us there, <hi>I have formerly named elder Testimonies not denied,</hi> I have searcht his <hi>Plea for Peace</hi> in that Chapter, where he purposely proves this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and I can find but one passage out of <hi>Clemens Romanus,</hi> and another of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> which I think will not do his business.</p>
               <p>His testimony from <hi>Clemens Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> in his famed Epistle to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> concerns the practice of the Apostles, and those who succeeded them in ordaining Bishops or Elders: Which was <hi>consensu universae ecclesiae,</hi> the Greek words are <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>those who were intrusted by God in Christ with this work</hi> (of ordaining Bishops and Deacons) <hi>did accordingly do it:</hi> Here we see the appointing or placing Bishops and Deacons is not referred to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and choice of the people, but to the Authority of God given them by Christ: which in the following words he parallels with <hi>Moses</hi> his giving the Priesthood to <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons, without the consent of the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, nay against it, as was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the contention of the other

                  </gap>od. And if the Apostles ordained Bishops and Deacons by as absolute an authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as this, the Church might be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with what they did, but could not contradict it: these things the <hi>Dean</hi> had more largely discoursed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> returns not one word of answer: and yet <hi>Clemens</hi> says that this was done not only by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles but <hi>by other eminent men</hi>

               <p>But he every where insists on that saying of St. <hi>Cyprian, that the people</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cypr. Ep. 88.</note>
                  <hi>had the greatest power to chuse worthy Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, or to refuse the unworthy.</hi> The <hi>Dean</hi> at large answered this testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and made it appear, that St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> gave no other right to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the Elections of Bishops, but to be present at them, and to bear te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of their lives and conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as is evident from the whole series of that Epistle; this he confirms
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:204354:308"/> by the practice of <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> who in imitation of the Christians in the choice of their Bishops, <hi>proposed the names of his civil officers to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to hear what they had to object against them;</hi> which proves, that he who lived among them, and might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed to know the nature of such publick Elections, understood no more but that the people were to be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of the good or bad lives of those to be ordained Bishops, for he never intended the people should chuse his officers, in imitation of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; and confirms it by a testimony of <hi>Origen</hi> concerning this practice and the nature of it.</p>
               <p>To all this Mr. <hi>B.</hi> replies little, and nothing to the purpose; but only that the words signifie more than te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony: <hi>for the chief chusing power of the worthy is more than testimony of fact:</hi> but chusing is a word of a large sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, and may be given to all, who any way contribute to the choice, whether by testimony, or vote and suffrage, and therefore we must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the sense of any particular place where it is used, by the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of the discourse, not from the
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:204354:309"/> largest and most comprehensive signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the word: But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> says, <hi>these words signifie more than testimony [by publick judgement and testimony be approved worthy and meet]</hi> but Mr. <hi>B.</hi> should have given us the whole sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, <hi>That the Bishop</hi>

<pb n="537" facs="tcp:204354:309"/> adds, it is said <hi>(that by the suffrage of the whole fraternity the Episcopacy be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to him)</hi> which refers to the choice of <hi>Sabinus,</hi> and yet there he makes a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>the suffrage of the</hi>

               <p n="4">4.

               <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> seems to be sensible of this inconvenience, and does what he can to deliver himself from it, but to no purpose: He <hi>distinguishes between</hi>

                  <hi>giving the power, and concurring with other causes to give a receptivity to the Person that must have it, the peoples con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent is the</hi> causa partialis <hi>of receptivity and capacity:</hi> and yet the people no Judges, Who must have this power? There are but two things required in Ordinations, the giving the power or judging to whom it should be given.

<pb n="542" facs="tcp:204354:314"/> is, which the people give.</p>
               <p>But he would fain recant what he has granted, and proved that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have some power in ordination, in these words: <hi>But what signifie these words (the ordination of our Collegue</hi> Sabinus <hi>by the suffrage of the whole fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, and by the judgement of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops) is not this as much power as we plead for?</hi> Yes Sir, and a great deal more, for you have given away all power in ordinations; but we own with St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> that the people are proper witnesses of their conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which I have already shown is all he means by the suffrage of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>A little after he thinks upon another distinction. <hi>It was not usual to ordain</hi> sine titulo, <hi>and the ordainers did two things at once. 1. Judge absolutely who shall be a Minister of Christ. 2. Judge with the Church to which he was ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>

                  <hi>(elders and people) who was fit for that Church, and should be theirs:</hi> but this is all Romance and fiction to serve a cause: the action was but one, and considered as one, whatever distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and different respects a meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physical wit may find in it; when any
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:204354:314"/> Church was empty, the neighbour Bishops, and the Clergy and people of the vacant Church met for the choice of a new Bishop for that Church: The people gave testimony of his life and manners, the Bishops judged of his other Pastoral qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and if they could agree in the same man, he was ordained their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop; but there was no consideration at all, whether he should be a Bishop in general, but whether he should be Bishop of that Church: and therefore it is evident, the people have no more power in chusing their Bishop, than they have in making a Bishop, which was the very same action; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore according to Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples they have none at all, but we allow that according to the ancient practice and constitutions of the Church, they were witnesses of their conversation, and may be so still.</p>
               <p>One thing I confess he has proved, that the people in many places, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when there were different inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests and perswasions among them, did sometimes by noise and tumults, and open force over-rule the Election against the consent of Prince, Bishops
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:204354:315"/> and Clergy; and if this be thought sufficient to give a right, our dissenting people may, as indeed they do, follow their example, and set up Ministers to themselves in defiance of Authority and Laws.</p>
               <p>As for what Mr. <hi>B.</hi> answers to that historical account the <hi>Dean</hi> has given of these popular Elections, it is so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable, and so full of shifts, that no man who reads both with any care, will desire any farther vindication of it: and therefore I shall only give some instances of his way of answering. I have already considered what he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers to the first thing alledged by the <hi>Dean, that the main ground of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples interest was founded on the Apostles Canon, That a Bishop must be blameless and of good report.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second thing alledged by the <hi>Dean</hi> is, <hi>that the people upon this as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming</hi>

                  <hi>the power of elections, caused great disturbance and disorder in the Church.</hi> To this Mr. <hi>B.</hi> answers 1. <hi>And yet for all these disorders, the Church deprived not the people of their priviledge:</hi> and why was it? because they could not. For <hi>Greg. Nazianzen,</hi> St. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> St. <hi>Hierom, Origen,</hi> as the <hi>Dean</hi> proved,
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:204354:315"/> declared their dislike of it, and how desirous they were it should be altered, which me-thinks is a plain argument, that they did not believe it to be an Inherent and unalterable right, either by the Law of Nature, or a Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, for if they had such wise and good men would not have desired the alteration of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He answers, that all these disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which are charged upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, were owing to the ambition of Clergy men: <hi>the aspiring Prelates seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Patriarchates and B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>te? the inconveniencies of popular electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons it seems are intolerable, and it does not better the case, whether they be thus mutinous and troublesome out of their own folly and giddiness, or the
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:204354:316"/> suggestions and perswasions of others.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Dean</hi> adds, <hi>that to prevent these inconveniencies many Bishops were appointed without the choice of the people, and Canons were made for the regulation of Elections.</hi> To this Mr. <hi>B.</hi> answers, <hi>Craftily said!</hi> So men of craft are apt to suspect plain honest men; but wherein is this craft? Why, <hi>he saith not [without the consent of the people] but [the election]</hi> but whatever distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction Mr. <hi>B.</hi> may make between these, the <hi>Dean</hi> means honestly, nothing more (suppose) than a Negative Voice, that there can be no election without them. <hi>And he saith not, that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons took away either consenting or ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting suffrages, but that they regulated them, yes they over and over confirmed them.</hi> Sometimes they did one, and <note place="margin">Second Def. <hi>p.</hi> 138.</note> sometimes t'other, which is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against an Inherent and unalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable right.</p>
               <p>The <hi>D.</hi> instances in the election at <hi>Alexandria</hi> by the twelve Presbyters, to which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> answers, 1. <hi>Does the Dr. think that the Presbyters choice ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth the peoples?</hi> Not alwayes, but it is plain it did in this case, as all men know, who know the story; and he
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:204354:316"/> offers nothing to prove, that it did not. 2. <hi>Will he conclude, that whenever the History nameth not the peoples choice, it is left out?</hi> When it is named as a particular custome, peculiar to one Church, there is reason to think so. 3. <hi>Will he perswade us, that when the people are not the chusers, they are not necessarily the consenters or refusers?</hi> Yes, they are bound by the custome of their Church to be the consenters, but not refusers: and so they ought to be at this day, to acquiesce in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of elections confirmed and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished by the Laws of our Church.</p>
               <p>What he sayes of the tumults of <hi>Alexandria</hi> in after dayes, is owing to the change of this custome; for there were no tumults at elections before, which is a plain demonstration of the difference between limited and popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar elections, though their souls were as well taken care of before without such tumults.</p>
               <p>As for the Ordination of <hi>Germanion</hi> and <hi>Gordius</hi> at <hi>Hierusalem</hi> ordained by the Bishops in the place of <hi>Narcissus</hi> without any mention of the peoples consent; he answers, this is no argument that because the peoples consent is not
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:204354:317"/> mentioned, therefore they did not give their consent; but I think it a good argument, when <hi>Eusebius</hi> uses to be so punctual in giving an account of the manner of Elections; never leaving out the people, when there was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to put them in. But how do the words of <hi>Eusebius</hi> confute this, when he sayes, <hi>that when</hi> Narcissus <hi>shewed himself again, the Brethren (no doubt the Laity,</hi> but any man who will doubt, may with the same reason Mr. <hi>B.</hi> doubts of other things, who will believe nothing against him less than a Mathematical demonstration) <hi>intreated him to enjoy his Bishoprick again?</hi> What is this to the election of the former Bishops without their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent? If it were on Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s side, he would think it a good argument, that they did not chuse their former Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, because they were so willing to receive their old Bishop again.</p>
               <p>The next instances are of several Bishops, who sensible of the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies of these popular elections appointed their Successors in their life time; as <hi>Severus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Milevis,</hi> St. <hi>Austin, Paulus</hi> the <hi>Novatian</hi> Bishop at <hi>Constantinople.</hi> All that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:204354:317"/> is, that it hence appears, that the people had the election; because St. <hi>Austin</hi> was desired to go to <hi>Milevis</hi> to perswade the people to accept their Bishop, and he himself in his life time, as being deservedly in great esteem among his people, perswades them to accept of a Bishop of his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating; which was much the same case with <hi>Paulus</hi> the <hi>Novatian,</hi> whose Presbyters desired him to nominate his Successor for fear they should not agree. I grant what Mr. <hi>B.</hi> sayes, that this does prove, that <hi>de facto</hi> the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at that time did chuse their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, but it proves a little more, that wise men were sensible of the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of it, and took the best course they could to prevent it; which supposes, that they thought it a custom which might be very well parted with, and not essential to a Pastoral relation.</p>
               <p>Thus Mr. <hi>B.</hi> sayes, that the Canon <note place="margin">Concil. Antioch. c. 18.</note> of the Council of <hi>Antioch</hi> alledged by the <hi>Dean, that if one be ordained Bishop, and go not to the Parish</hi> (as he tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slates it) <hi>because the people refuse him, he shall have the honour and office of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, not troubling the peace of the Church,</hi>
                  <pb n="550" facs="tcp:204354:318"/> makes against him, as proving that the people had then the power of chusing or refusing: but on the other hand, it makes for the <hi>Dean,</hi> by proving, that the Bishops of those dayes, did not think it an Inherent right in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to do either, for then they would not have ordained one for them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their consent. The same answer will serve for what is objected against St. <hi>Basil</hi>'s consecration of <hi>Euphronius</hi> without the consent of the people. But his answer to the Law of <hi>Justinian,</hi> which excluded the common people from the election of Bishops, is very pleasant; <hi>that this rather proves the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples power, that so long after by an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour the poorer sort were restrained;</hi> it proves indeed <hi>de facto,</hi> that it was so, but the restraining of this power proves that it was not thought inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and unalterable; and when Mr. <hi>B.</hi> returned such answers as these, and took it in so much scorn, that the <hi>Dean</hi> should help him with more Citations to prove his cause, certainly he had quite forgot what the <hi>D.</hi> undertook to prove, not that the people never did chuse their Bishops, but that wise Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, Councils and Princes, were sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:204354:318"/> of the mischief and danger of it, and by degrees endeavoured to restrain or regulate it.</p>
               <p>His answer to the <hi>Canon of Laodicea,</hi> which as the <hi>D.</hi> observed, <hi>excluded the common people from chusing any into the Clergy,</hi> savours of a desperate cause, for he is fore't to pervert the Canon by a false translation, and make non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense of it into the bargain to get rid of it: He tells us <hi>Crab</hi> translates it thus, <hi>quod non sit permittendum turbis</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the Greek) <hi>electiones eorum facere, qui sunt ad sacerdotium prove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendi:</hi> the English is this, <hi>that it must not be allowed to the multitude to chuse into the Clergy:</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> translates it, <hi>it is not sufferable to chuse by tumults.</hi> Which is an admirable Decree for a Council; and an argument of the great skill or honesty of a Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slator.</p>
               <p>The <hi>D.</hi> alledges, <hi>that the second</hi> Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene <hi>Council,</hi> Can. 3. <hi>restrained the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction only to Bishops, which was consirmed by following Councils in the Greek Church:</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> cannot deny the thing, but finds something in it, which unchur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches the Church of <hi>England: that if any Bishop use the Secular Magistrate to
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:204354:319"/> obtain by them a Church, let him be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed and separated, and all that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with him.</hi> How Mr. <hi>B.</hi> has translated it I cannot tell, because I have not that Council by me; but the sense of it is sufficiently plain, that no man must perswade a Prince by force and power to make him Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, which we know was often the case, but we cannot suppose that Council to deny the Emperour his consent and approbation, nay, nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a fit person, any more than other Councils do the people, which yet forbid a Bishop to seek that Sacred Office by Votes, that is, to endeavour to perswade people to give their Votes for him; as the <hi>Orleance</hi> Council does, <note place="margin">Second Def. of Non. conf. <hi>p.</hi> 129.</note> as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> himself relates it: and thus the Church of <hi>England</hi> is safe, though her Bishops are advanced by the Kings favour and nomination, granted by the Laws of Church and State, which are of greater authority with us in all alterable Constitutions, than much better Councils, than the second of <hi>Nice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is sufficient to give a tast of Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s way of answering the Dean, his other answers are very like it;
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:204354:319"/> and many of them have already been considered upon other occasions.</p>
               <p>Having thus considered, what the peoples right is in chusing their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, there is but one inquiry more behind;</p>
               <p>III. Whether there be any cases wherein the people may insist on a right of choice; for Mr. <hi>B.</hi> loves to confound what is ordinary and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with what is extraordinary, and to make the same rule for both, as I have already observed; and thus he does here. He puts a great many hard cases, as suppose a Prince be a Papist, a Pagan, a Mahometan; sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose he chuse Atheists and Infidels and notorious Hereticks, or Ideots for our Pastors, and we can have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but such, must we be contented with such Pastors as these, may not any Prince at this rate quickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy all Religion, and set up what he will in the room of it? I Answer, when the case is really thus, in Gods name let the people chuse better for themselves, and maintain the honour and interest of Religion and take care of their souls, whoever sayes nay;
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:204354:320"/> and if Mr. <hi>B.</hi> thinks, that this is the present state of things, I think their separation is very innocent and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, and nothing but what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes good Christians. Let him speak out, we desire no favour, he sees our Articles, our Liturgy, which what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he thinks of us, we heartily sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe, and assent and consent to; if this be Popery or Mahometism, let him but tell us, what Christianity is, and we will be his Converts; but in the mean time let him consider, what guilt he contracts by perswading ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and unstable people into a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful separation by such arguments, as can never justifie men under a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Prince, and in a Christian Church.</p>
               <p>But suppose we have such Pastors set over us as are under a great suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of concealed Heresie, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be proved; Can concealed Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie do people any mischief? For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he be, he cannot propagate his infection, while he keeps it to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. And it is a mighty fault for peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to suspect their Pastors of Heresie, when there is not sufficient evidence for it: but this indeed is not the fault
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:204354:320"/> of the people, but of their Teachers, who to secure them in a faction, paint Conformists in horrid and frightful shapes, to deter their Converts from any thoughts of returning to their Communion.</p>
               <p>But suppose some Conforming Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters be horribly vicious and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane: I hope there are few (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever faults they may have) deserve this character. If there be any such vile wretches, who are a reproach to their Function and to Religion, all le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal courses ought to be used for their removal, which must certainly be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, if they be so notoriously wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; or if they be not removed, yet it is no just occasion for Schism and Separation, while religious Offices, and the administration of Sacraments are performed according to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of the Church; and seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Christians have so many other helps for their souls, as I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy proved. St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> I confess, did think any notorious crime a sufficient reason to forsake the communion of such a Bishop, but this was anciently thought as great a mistake in him, as his rebaptization of Hereticks;
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:204354:321"/> and St. <hi>Austin</hi> in his disputes against the <hi>Donatists,</hi> and I think the most learned Divines of all Communions for several ages have condemned it: However when this infection is not general, as our greatest enemies cannot say it is at this day, it is more excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable to withdraw from the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of a Parochial Minister, upon such accounts, and to joyn with neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Parishes, which are better sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, than to forsake the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church; which can never be lawful till absolute and unavoidable necessity justifie it.</p>

               <head type="sub">What Communion is essential to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of a National Church.</head>
               <p>OUR next Inquiry is concerning a National Church. I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready vindicated the constitution of National Churches, as founded on a Divine Law of Catholick Unity, which does not only justifie, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire such union and combination of Churches, as is for the preservation of order and unity, and the better edification and government of the Church. But since Church-Unity consists in one communion, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to explain more particularly, what that communion is, which is es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential to a National Church, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered as a Church. Now to state this matter as clearly as I can, to lay a foundation for a plain answer to Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s question, <hi>What the Church of</hi> England <hi>is,</hi> and <hi>who is the constitutive
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:204354:322"/> Regent head of it;</hi> I shall distinguish between a National Church consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a Church, and as a Church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated with the State, and speak distinctly to each of them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let us consider a National Church as a Church, or a Religious Society, for so I must profess, as the Dean did, <hi>I do believe there were Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi>

For Patriarchal and Metropolitan combinations of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are of the same nature with what we call National Churches, and such there were in the times of Paganism under Heathen and Persecuting Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours. Now here are two things to be distinctly stated. 1. What kind of Church a National Church is. 2. What Communion is essential to it, considered as a Church.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What kind of Church a Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Church is: and here I shall exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine two questions, 1. Whether it be
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:204354:322"/> properly called a Church. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>2. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be a Political Body.</p>
               <p>(1.) Whether a National Church be properly called a Church. For the Author <hi>of the Peaceable Design</hi> in his answer to the Dean, sayes, <hi>That to be</hi>
                  <note place="margin">An An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to Dr. <hi>Still. p.</hi> 14.</note>
                  <hi>particular or universal is of essential con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration to Christs Church, but to be national is of accidental consideration:</hi> and his reason for it is this: <hi>That all the people of the Land should be Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and the Magistrate also is (I say) an accidental thing to the Church, which may exist where that is not:</hi> and hence he infers; <hi>upon which account though the Magistrate be none of Christs proper Officers, yet may he be head of his Church, and constitutive Head of it, as under his dominions, because he is Head not in any essential, but in this accidental conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of it:</hi> so that if this Author say true, the National Church is not a proper essential, but an accidental Church: for I suppose that is the meaning of its <hi>not being a Church in an essential, but accidental consideration,</hi> and thus my distinction between a National Church considered as a Church, and as incorporated into the state is out of doors; for it is a
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:204354:323"/> Church only as it is the state, and headed by the Civil Magistrate.</p>
               <p>But there are two things supposed in his argument as necessary to the being of a national Church, neither of which are necessary, 1. That all the people of the Nation should be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, and 2. That the King or nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal government should be so also: and then there could be nothing like a National Church for three hundred years and more, till <hi>Constantine</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced Christianity; and yet it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to any man, who is not so fond of beating out notions, that he can be contented to take a little book-learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him, that there were many great combinations of Churches, which made up one body, and used to meet in Synods and Councils together to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise about the publick affairs of the Church and of Religion, long before those times; and these I take to be equivalent to a National Church, which I take to be the union of all the Christian Churches in a Nation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one Body and Society. And why this should be called an accidental consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the Christian Church, any more than the Universal Church it self
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:204354:323"/> is; I cannot tell. Our Saviour gave command to his Apostles to go teach all Nations, and plant Churches in them, and therefore this was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of our Saviour, that there should be Churches in all Nations, as well as in all the World: And if all the Churches in the World must make but one Church, then certainly much more must all the Churches in the same Nation be but one, which are in a nearer capacity of communion with each other, than the Churches of all the World are; and whereby Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick unity and communion may be more easily preserved, than if all the particular Churches in a Nation were single and Independent; there being a more easie correspondence between Nations, than between every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Town and City in distant Nations. But I have already discours'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               <p>The Author of the <hi>Peaceable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign</hi> in his Answer, sings over the same Song, <hi>That there is a government in the Church of</hi> England, <hi>I hope the Dr. does not doubt:</hi> No Sir, I will venture to grant this for him. <hi>Where there is</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 12.</note>
                  <hi>a government established, there must be a Political Society;</hi> here this Author wants Mr. <hi>B.</hi> 's subtilty: if Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment makes a Political Society, we grant a National Church is a Political Society, for government by consent, without superiority, is government. But he adds, <hi>every political body consists of a</hi> pars imperans <hi>and</hi> subdita: this I grant too, Church-governours united and governing by consent, are the <hi>Pars Imperans,</hi> Christian people in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Laws of our Saviour, submitting to such government are the <hi>pars subdita;</hi> and all this is true without a constitutive Regent Head. And that this is all that is or can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to make a National Church one, considered as a Church, I prove by these two arguments.</p>
               <p>First, that the entire notion of Church-unity consists in one commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:204354:326"/> this is the unity of a particular, national, and universal Church, as I have already proved; the whole power of Church officers consists in taking in, or putting out of the Church: and therefore a Church society, as such, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from a civil-political-body, armed with civil power and juridiction.</p>
               <p>Now consent is all that can be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to unite a body or society in one communion, for a body that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists, and is one by consent, has all things necessary to unity and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in a joynt consent: this consent indeed is not an arbitrary thing, but is made necessary by a divine law, and if we enquire after that superiour power, which unites all these Church-Governours in one consent, and keeps them together, so Christ is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutive Regent Head of the National, as well as Universal Church: for it is by his Authority, and as they are all accountable to him, that they unite into one body; and govern their several Churches by mutual consent, advice and counsel; but yet their uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty consists only in consent, not in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Superiour-Governing-Ecclesiastical power on earth, which binds them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. For,</p>
               <pb n="567" facs="tcp:204354:326"/>
               <p>Secondly, Christ hath instituted no such constitutive regent power of one Bishop over another in his Church; and therefore the union of particular Churches into one must be made by consent, not by superiority of power: The Apostles were all invested by Christ with equal power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> tells us, <hi>that all the other Apostles were, what</hi> Peter <hi>was, equal</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hoc utique erant &amp; caeteri Apostoli, quod fuit Petrus, pari consortio praediti &amp; honoris &amp; potestatis.—Apostolis omnibus post resurrectionem suam parem potestatem tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at. <hi>Cypr. de unitate Eccles.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <hi>sharers with him in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and power, and that Christ gave all his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles equal power after his resurrection.</hi> And as the Ancient Fathers always asserted Bishops to be the Apostles successors, so they did as constantly affirm all Bishops to be equal: it is a known saying of St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> that <hi>whereever the Bishop be, at</hi> Rome, <hi>or</hi> Eugubium, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hierom. ad Evagr. Ep.</hi> 85.</note>
                  <hi>or</hi> Constantinople, <hi>&amp;c. he is of equal merit, and of the same Priesthood:</hi> and therefore as I shewed above, St. <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> asserts, that there is but <hi>one Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy</hi> (as there is but one Altar in the whole Church) of which every Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop has an equal portion:</p>
               <p>There are three or four things very
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:204354:327"/> evident in Antiquity, as I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy sufficiently proved, which plainly shew, both that several particular Churches may and ought to unite in one body, and that such a body can be governed only by a mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the Bishops of those particular Churches, which are thus united into one: As (1.) the obligations to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick communion, as I have before observed, is the foundation of this union. (2.) Every particular Bishop is the supreme Governour in his own Diocess: (3.) That yet every Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop has a relation to the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church, and concerned as far as he can to take care of the whole, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of neighbouring Churches, which are under his eye, and nearer inspection: and therefore (4.) That those Bishops, especially whose vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and neighbourhood makes them capable of such a union, should go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern their Churches by mutual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and counsel, and observe the same laws and rules of worship, discipline, and government; and when Mr. <hi>B.</hi> can give me any reason, why this may not be called one Church, one Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical-body-Politick, without a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutive
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:204354:327"/> Regent Head, I'll think fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of it.</p>
               <p>All that I can find he says to this is, that this is not one government of the Church considered as National, <hi>it is</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Second Def. of Non-conf. <hi>p.</hi> 115.</note>
                  <hi>not one Church but an association of many Churches, such as a thousand Independent Churches may make, or the Churches of many Kingdoms.</hi> I answer, 1. I can see no reason, why that may not be called one government, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by common advice, counsel, and consent, though administred by particular Bishops in their own Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess: for in this case every Bishop go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns his Diocess by common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and is accountable to his associ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Bishops for male-administration. 2. As for Independent Churches they can never be thus united, because though indeed they may consent if they please, yet they may not also, if they please, they being according to their fundamental principles and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal constitution absolute and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent; and therefore may stand by themselves if they please: but now we assert, that all Bishops according to the standing laws of Catholick uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and communion ought thus to asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:204354:328"/> by mutual consent, and that those are Schismaticks not Catholick Bishops, who do not: and this is the constitution, which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> enquires after, which we have, and which the Independents have not, for if they had, they were no longer Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, but like Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s Parochial Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We assert no other difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a National consent and associati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Churches, and the association of the Churches of many Kingdoms, or the universal Church; but only in the different degrees of communion, which are owing to neighbourhood, their living in one nation, and under one civil government. The Churches of the same Nation, under the same Prince, may more advantageously unite in the same rules of worship and discipline, whose civil customs, and manners, and way of life are the same, which very much influence Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal constitutions; whose Bishops upon any emergent occasions may more conveniently meet together for advice and counsel, and where appeals may be heard and determined with least trouble; where both Bishops and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:204354:328"/> do more frequently converse with each others, and joyn in the publick offices of religion: these are nearer acts of Christian communion, than we can enjoy with the Churches of foreign nations, whose civil laws and customs differ, and whose Princes pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly do not well agree, and whose distance will not admit of such a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential communion,</hi> (as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> speaks) as is required to such association of Churches; but could this be done in several Kingdoms, nay, in all the world as conveniently as in one Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I should think there were no need of such National associations.</p>
               <p>And now I think I have fairly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared the way to justifie that answer the <hi>Dean</hi> gave to Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s inquiry, what is the constituent Regent Head of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> to which he answers two things, 1. <hi>That it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Unreas. of Separat. <hi>p.</hi> 300.</note>
                  <hi>upon a false supposition, which is, that whereever there is the true notion of a Church, there must be a constitutive Regent part, that is, there must be a stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing governing power, which is an essential part of it.</hi> To which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> replies, 1. by excepting against that phrase of <note place="margin">Sec. Def. <hi>p.</hi> 117.</note>
                  <hi>the true notion of a Church,</hi> and would
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:204354:329"/> have the <hi>Dean</hi> put in the political no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which had been wise work, when the <hi>Dean</hi> denies such a politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal governing power as he asserts, but of this above: and therefore the true notion of a Church was the properest term the <hi>D.</hi> could use, for it was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to every man, what Church he spoke of, not such equivocal Churches, as <hi>a Ship full, or Prison full, or House full of Christians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. He asks, <hi>is not government essential to a governed Church?</hi> and does the <hi>D.</hi> deny this? is not government by consent a government? is there no government, but where there is <hi>a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutive regent Head?</hi> let Mr. <hi>B.</hi> prove this.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Dean</hi> proves there is no need of a constitutive Regent part to make a <note place="margin">Ib.</note> Church from Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s own concessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>that there is one Catholick visible Church, and that all particular Churches, as headed by their particular Bishops or Pastors, are parts of the universal Church. Now if this doctrine be true, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al it be necessary, that every Church must have a constitutive Regent part as essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to it, then it unavoidably follows, that there must be a Catholick visible
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:204354:329"/> Head to the Catholick visible Church, and so Mr.</hi> B.'<hi>s constitutive Regent part of a Church hath done the Pope a wonderful kindness, and made a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry plausible plea for his universal Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storship.</hi> The <hi>D.</hi> indeed owns, <hi>that Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>says, that the universal Church is headed by Christ himself,</hi> but adds, <hi>that this doth not remove the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty; for the question is about that visible Church, whereof the particular Churches are parts, and they being visible parts do require a visible constitutive Regent head as essential to them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the whole visible Church must have likewise a visible constitutive Regent part,</hi> i. e. <hi>a visible head of the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and his flattering Eccho very wisely start aside from the main argument (as being at an irrecovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble loss) to pursue at fresh game: and they found a very fair opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for it, from the dispute of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of a visible head to the visible Catholick Church. The Author of the peaceable design, thinks <hi>it enough</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Answ. to Dr. <hi>Still. p.</hi> 18.</note>
                  <hi>that Christ is the head of those who are visible:</hi> But yet disputes very learned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that Christ is the visible head of his Church: because he was visible
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:204354:330"/> when he was on earth, and is now visible in Heaven. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is much concerned, that after he has written so much against <hi>Johnson</hi> the Papist about the Visible Head, the <hi>Dean</hi> charges him with such principles, as will in the issue justifie the Popes claim to the Catholick Visible Pastorship: and to be even with him, he trys to make him a Papist, and crys out, <hi>Is this our Champion against Popery now?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sec. Def. <hi>p.</hi> 118.</note> and thus this matter is pretty well adjusted. But he thinks it no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, that there should be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible Head to a visible Body, for so God who is invisible is, what? the invisible Head of all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the world? that he would not say, <hi>but all the Kingdoms of the world are visible parts of his universal Kingdom, though he be invisible,</hi> which is nothing to the purpose: but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, no man dares deny that Christ is the universal Head of his Church: that we grant, but not the Visible Head: and we are far from asserting <hi>that the universal Head must be visible if the subordinate be so:</hi> but this we assert, that if no Church can be a true visible Church without a subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:204354:330"/> visible Head, then the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Church cannot be a visible Church without a subordinate Catholick visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Head, no more than a National Church can: But he says, <hi>this is to turn the controversie from the necessity of a Regent Head, to the necessity of his visibility:</hi> This I deny, for when the question is about a constitutive Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Head on earth, it concerns a visible Head on earth: for if an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible Head in Heaven would end the controversie, we could find him the same Regent Head for a national, as he has done for the universal Church: for I hope Christ is Head of every part of his Church as well as of the whole.</p>
               <p>The true state of the question after all this pother is this: Mr. <hi>B.</hi> attempts to prove, that a national Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be one political Church, unless it have a constitutive Regent Head; does he mean this of a visible Head on earth, or not: if not, then as I now observed, we can soon end this controversie, by asserting Christ to be the Head of the national Church, and let him disprove it if he can: if he does mean it of a visible Head on
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:204354:331"/> earth, then how does he answer the <hi>Dean</hi>'s argument, that if no Church is a true Church, which has not a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible constitutive Regent Head on earth, who visibly governs the Church in subordination to Christ the invisible Head in Heaven: then the Catholick Church is not one true visible Church, unless he will find a visible Head for it, and this will be a great kindness to the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> who will then dispute his title with any new pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders: this he has made no reply to, and I suspect, he understands very good reason for it.</p>
               <p>To what the <hi>Dean</hi> has thus unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerably objected, I shall add but this one thing more; that to deny a Church can be one without a constitutive Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Head, does necessarily infer a denial of one of these two things, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 1. that many particular Churches can combine and associate into one, for the joynt exercise of discipline and government, which overthrows the very notion of Catholick unity and communion, or 2. that there is and must be a power in the Church supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to the Episcopal power, which naturally sets up a Pope above Bishops.</p>
               <pb n="577" facs="tcp:204354:331"/>
               <p>It is evident from the Testimony of the earliest ages of the Church, that first the Apostles, and then the Bishops as their successors, were the supreme Governours of the Church, who had no higher order or power over them: and therefore <hi>Tertullian</hi> calls the Bishop Summus Sacerdos, <hi>the chief or high<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It was not indeed a superiour pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but the obligation to Christian communion, which united them in one body; nor was it lawful to deny Christian communion for every diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent practice or opinion in matters of discipline, for which St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves <hi>Stephen</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> in this very cause, and before him, <hi>Irenaeus</hi> Pope <hi>Victor</hi> about the Paschal contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie: But if any Bishop was noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously Heretical, or guilty of any
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:204354:332"/> great vice, then they withdrew from his communion by publick consent and judgement, and ordained another in his room, and exhorted the people to forsake him; as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> did in the case of <hi>Basilides</hi> and <hi>Martialis.</hi> And thus a Bishop may be deposed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any superiour authority over him, as a Bishop, as well as a private Christian be excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: For the Church has certainly au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to cast all unworthy members out of its Communion, whether Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy or Laity.</p>
               <p>Nor does this overthrow that very ancient constitution of Patriarchal or Metropolitan Churches: For a Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch or Metropolitan was not a supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour order to Bishops, nor included any authority over them, as is evident from what St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> discoursed, who was himself a Primate, but only some precedency in the same order, and such advantages of power in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, as was given them by the common consent of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, for a greater publick good: as the power of calling Provincial Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, and presiding in them, and a principal interest in the ordination of
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:204354:333"/> Bishops in his Province, and the like: which were determined and limited by Ecclesiastical Canons.</p>
               <p>It is true, this Patriarchal power did in time degenerate into domination and Empire, when it fell into the hands of ambitious men, but was ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally (and is so still, when wise and good men have the management of it,) a very prudent constitution to preserve peace and order, and good discipline in the Church.</p>
               <p>But that Arch-Bishops and Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politans had no proper superiority and jurisdiction over Bishops is very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from what St. <hi>Hierom</hi> objects against the discipline of the <hi>Montanists. Among us (i. e.</hi> the Catholicks) <hi>the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hieron. ad Marcell. Ep. 54.</note>
                  <hi>Bishops enjoy the place of the Apostles, among them the Bishop is but the third: For they have the Patriarchs of</hi> Pepusa <hi>in</hi> Phrygia <hi>for the first, those whom they call</hi> Cenones <hi>for the second; thus Bishops are thrust down into the third, that is, almost the last place:</hi> and yet in St. <hi>Hierom</hi>'s time the Catholick Church had Arch-Bishops and Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politans, but it seems not such as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded Bishops, or advanced any above them: And methinks this is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:204354:333"/> testimony against Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s Parochial Bishops, whom he calls the lowest Bishops, for Bishops were always the highest order in the Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second thing the <hi>Dean</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers, contains <hi>the resolution</hi> of the question, <hi>that we deny any necessity of any such constitutive Regent part, as one formal Ecclesiastical Head, as essential to a National Church: For a National consent is as sufficient to make a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Church, as an universal consent to make a Catholick Church.</hi> That this is the true resolution of the question has been sufficiently proved already; and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> returns no new <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nswer to it but this, <hi>No consent maketh a Catholick Church, but consenting to one Supreme Head Christ:</hi> then it seems the Catholick Church is one by no external visible bonds of union; but I have already proved, that the unity of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church consists in its consent and agreement in one Communion; and thus a National Church as a larger portion of the universal Church is one also.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="582" facs="tcp:204354:334"/>II. Having considered what kind of Church a National Church is, let us now consider, what acts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Communion are essential to a National Church; and I need not add much to what has been already hinted for the explication of this matter. As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That all the Churches in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion live in Communion with each other, and freely communicate toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as one and the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>me Church. And this answers Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s Query, <hi>Why do you pretend, that we are none of the Church of</hi> England—<hi>who deny not associated Chur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>es in</hi> England <hi>under one Civil Government:</hi> for whatever he means by this, it is plain they are not associated in one Communion with us, and therefore cannot make one Church, though they live under the same Civil Government: for separate Ecclesiastical Communions is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to the Notion and Being of One Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That they consent in the same Confession of Faith and Rules of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. Here Mr. <hi>B.</hi> desires to know what this consent is, which is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:204354:334"/> to make us members of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> because there are a great many differences among our selves concerning the sense of many Articles, and the different manner of explaining them: Now to consent to the Doctrine of any Church, is to believe those Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Faith, which it proposes as its Doctrine: but then where the Church has not determined every minute que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, but has left a latitude of sense to prevent Schisms and breaches upon every different opinion (as it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent the Church of <hi>England</hi> has done in some Articles, which are most li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the hottest disputes, which yet are penned with that temper, as to be willingly subscribed by men of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent apprehensions in those matters) those who live in the same commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and worship God together, are members of the same Church; which those who agree in the same Faith can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, who do not worship God in the same communion.</p>
               <p>I cannot say it is absolutely necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Constitution of a National Church, that all the particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches should have the same Liturgy and form of Worship, but certainly it is
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:204354:335"/> highly reasonable and convenient, that they should; and when it is so setled by mutual consent and advice, it is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Schism for any Church to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the common rule.</p>
               <p n="3">3. National communion requires, that the National Church be governed by common advice and consent, or by common Rules and Canons agreed and confirmed by mutual advice: And this as the <hi>Dean</hi> observed is declared in Convocations, which consist of Arch-Bishops, Bishops and Presbyters. For as the ancient Government of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las Churches was in the hands of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, with the advice of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Presbyters; so the Convocation for the Government of the National Church, by mutual consent consists of Bishops and their Presbyters; not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of all Presbyters, who could not be spared from their several Cures to meet in Convocation, but of such as are chosen by the inferiour Clergy for their Proxies: and such Ecclesiastical Canons or Rules of Discipline, agreed by mutual consent, though they have not the force of a Civil Law, till they are confirmed by Civil Authority, nor can bind a dissenting Bishop without
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:204354:335"/> the concurrence of some other obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet do oblige the Consciences of those Christian people, whose Bishops receive and own them; for if Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians are bound to submit to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Discipline of the Church as exercised by their Bishop, then much more, when their Bishop does not go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern arbitrarily, but by fixed Rules agreed by the common advice and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the Bishops and Clergy of the National Church.</p>
               <p>And thus we have found a National Church, and Church Government an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent to any humane authority; for as for that Objection, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is not one, but two Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Churches, with their distinct Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, it alters not the case, since both Provincial Synods act by mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, which makes them one Church, as much as all the Churches of the same Province are one.</p>
               <p>So vain is it, what Mr. <hi>B.</hi> insinuates, that we own <hi>no Government of the Church, but the Civil.</hi> And upon the same mistake, asks <hi>How old our Church is? what Parliament first made it? Does</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Second Def. of Nonconf. <hi>p.</hi> 116.</note>
                  <hi>it dye, and live again, as oft as Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments change it? How shall we prove,
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:204354:336"/> that the whole or half of the Nation, ever meant to put their consent into the hand of the Parliament to make a new Church of</hi> England, <hi>and to alter it? What men make, they may destroy. May not the Nation withdraw such consent, and the Parliament unmake their crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</hi> These I confess are all very smart Objections, had the <hi>Dean</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed no other original or being to the Church, but a National consent in Parliament, but if a National Church considered as a Church, be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent to any such consent in the nature of the thing, and does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon such a National consent to be a Church, but only to be incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated with the Civil Government, all these questions need no answer.</p>
               <p>A great many other questions he asks just to as much purpose as these, and proceeding upon the same mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake: as that the <hi>Dean</hi> has defended the Church of <hi>England</hi> fairly, by denying that <hi>there is any such Church in the questioned Political sense: that he</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 120.</note>
                  <hi>absolves all men from the duty of obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Church of</hi> England <hi>as such; and how can men be Schismaticks for disobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them that are not their Governours;</hi>
                  <pb n="587" facs="tcp:204354:336"/> with abundance more to the same Tune, all running upon this supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the <hi>Dean</hi> owns no National Church, nor Church authority, but what is owing to Civil Authority, which appearing to be so wild a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake, we will leave him to answer his questions himself, and now consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the National Church, as incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into the State.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The Church considered as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corborated into the State continues the same Church still, only back't and countenanced by Civil Authority: No Prince, nor Parliament have au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to make a new Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they have no authority to alter Divine or Apostolical Institutions: And therefore those are admirable No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion makers, who would make a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church of all the different forms of Churches <hi>by an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>

<pb n="588" facs="tcp:204354:337"/> and truly I must confess this would be a kind of an accidental Church.</p>
               <p>But the only difference between a National Church considered as a Church, and as it is incorporated into the State is this, that as a Church it has no other authority, but what is purely Ecclesiastical, consisting in Church censures, as incorporated into the State it enjoyes Civil priviledges, and is ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with Civil power: the King is its Civil Political Head, and though he has no authority, which is purely Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical, yet has authority over Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical persons: Church Canons when confirmed by Civil Authority, become the Laws of the Land, as much as any other Laws are, and Church Censures are backed with Civil pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments upon obstinate dissenters. And in this sense the <hi>Dean</hi> understood <note place="margin">Unreas. Separ. <hi>p.</hi> 299.</note> a National Church, when he answers that question, <hi>how it comes to be one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church:</hi> for he distinguishes this from another question, <hi>how all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations in</hi> England <hi>make up this one Church;</hi> which he answers, <hi>I say by unity of consent, as all particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches make one Catholick Church.</hi> Where it is plain, he means the Church as a
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:204354:337"/> Church: and therefore by the Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Church, he means the Church a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> incorporated into the State, and so an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers very truly, that it becomes a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church, <hi>because it was received</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 300.</note>
                  <hi>by the common consent of the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Parliament, as other Laws of the Nation are.</hi> Which shews how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s questions are upon this occasion; as <hi>what that common go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning power in the Church is, which this Parliament consent hath set up:</hi> that the <hi>D.</hi> told him before, was by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of Churches, and I suppose he will ask that question no more: and <hi>if it be by Parliament consent, how old is your Church?</hi> as confirmed by Act of Parliament, it is no elder than the first confirmation of it; but otherwise much elder than Presbyterie, or Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial Episcopacy. <hi>Doth it live and dye again as oft as Parliaments change it? May not the Parliament unmake their creatures?</hi> Yes they may, if they can alter an essential part of the Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; they may deprive it of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil authority, but it is a Church still. And as for his dispute, Whether a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional consent be included in what the
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:204354:338"/> Parliament does in matters of Religion, neither the <hi>D.</hi> I think, nor any body else for him, is bound to defend it; if there be but as much National con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, as there is to any other Law, which was all the <hi>Dean</hi> asserted: for we do not say, that the Parliament makes our Church, but only makes the Government and Discipline of the Church, the Law of the Land: and when he asks, <hi>how Dissenters come to be bound by Parliament consent? if it never was in their minds, to trust them as consenters for them?</hi> I know no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy asserts, that they are any otherwise bound, than they are by the other Parliamentary Laws; and if they think they are not bound by them, they may deliver themselves from the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of these, considered as Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Laws; and as for that dispute, whether <hi>the Laws bind them, only as consenting to them by their representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,</hi> I do not see, how the <hi>D.</hi> nor the cause he defends, is concerned in it; the Church of <hi>England</hi> is made the Law of the Nation, by as much National consent, as any other Law has, and that is sufficient to our
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:204354:338"/> purpose. Thus he asks, <hi>if the peoples</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 122.</note>
                  <hi>consent can make a National Church, why may it not make a Presbyterian, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent Church?</hi> but we say, the peoples consent makes neither, and an Act of Parliament may establish either by Law, though that Law cannot make them a Church, which must have a more Divine Institution. Thus <hi>if the Nations consent as such, make the Church of</hi> England, <hi>it is not made by Legislative power of King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> but therefore the <hi>D.</hi> speaks of no other National consent, but what is included in the Legislative power of King and Parliament, which does not make it a Church, but establish it by a Civil Sanction. <hi>Do the Church re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>present the King, or is he none of the Church?</hi> As King he is the Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the Church, as a private Christian, a member of it. <hi>How prove you, that the Clergy represent the Laity in the Convocation?</hi> Who sayes they do, or that there is any need they should? But <hi>by your rule, if divers parties of Christians agree to set up divers forms of Church Governments with mutual forbearance, they would be one
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:204354:339"/> National Church.</hi> That can never be, because mutual forbearance cannot make them one Communion, which is essential to a National Church. Thus easie is it to answer this man of many questions, when once the case is plainly stated, I think I have considered what is most popularly objected by him, and dare venture any ordinary Reader with the rest.</p>

               <head type="sub">What Communion is essential to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick or Ʋniversal Church.</head>
               <p>HAving already discourst so large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the communion of Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>san and National Churches, I need not add much more about Catholick Communion, or the Communion of the Universal Church: that there is such a thing, which unites the whole Christian Church into one body, I have already proved at large, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in given sufficient intimations, what this Catholick Communion is, and wherein it consists.</p>
               <p>I have already proved the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church to be one visible body and society, and therefore need not now add any thing more to confute that opinion, that the Catholick Church is invisible, which is asserted by Doctor <hi>Owen,</hi> and his Independent Brethren. But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and others who
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:204354:340"/> acknowledge one visible Catholick Church consisting of all the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches of the world, do not much differ from Dr. <hi>O.</hi>'s invisible Church, while they make the unity of this Church to consist only in their union to Christ as Head of the Church, not in the union of Churches as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the same body: for I take it not to be enough that all Churches are united to Christ, unless they be all uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in one body; for the whole Church cannot be the one body of Christ, unless all particular Churches are one body: and therefore I would desire Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and his Brethren to tell us, how the whole Catholick Church is united into one body: I assert this is done by one communion; if he can tell any better way, I would gladly learn it; especially if he can tell me, how all Churches can be one body without one Communion. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce all to as narrow a compass, as I can, I shall briefly discourse these two things. 1. What that communion is, which makes the Catholick Church one body. 2. What place there can be for Catholick Communion, in such a broken and divided state of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:204354:340"/> Churches, as we see at this day.</p>
               <p n="1">I. What that Communion is, which makes the Catholick Church one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. And I shall not here insist on Catholick Doctrine or Catholick Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which are necessarily supposed as the foundations of Catholick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; but yet are not sufficient to make the Church one, when they do not unite all in one communion, as I have already proved: but Catholick Communion strictly so called, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally consists in two things; 1. In the agreement and concord of the Bishops of the Catholick Church among themselves and with each other. 2. In the communion of particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Christians with one another.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the concord and agreement of the Bishops of the Catholick Church with each other: for the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops being the supream Governors of their particular Churches, their agreement and consent is necessary to Catholick Communion. This is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently evident from what St. <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> affirms, that there is but one Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy in the Christian Church, of
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:204354:341"/> which every Bishop has an equal share, and therefore that all the Bishops in the world are Collegues, and no man can have the authority or honour of a Bishop, who does not preserve the peace and unity of the Episcopacy, that is, who does not live in unity with his fellow Bishops. That the Catholick Church is one, when it is not rent and divided, but united and coupled by the cement of Bishops, who stick close together, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready <note place="margin">Vide supr. <hi>c.</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 208. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> discoursed at large.</p>
               <p>And hence it is evident, that a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior power over Bishops is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to the unity of the Church, for no man does more plainly deny that, than St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> does, and yet no man is a more resolute asserter of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Communion than he is.</p>
               <p>Now there were several wayes whereby this communion among Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops <note place="margin">Et mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim tibi proximè nomina Episcopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum istic constituto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, qui integri &amp; sani in Ecclesia Catholica frarribus praesunt.

Thus St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
                  <pb n="597" facs="tcp:204354:341"/> sends a catalogue of the names of Catholick Bishops to <hi>Cornelius</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Rome,</hi> that he might know to whom to write, and from whom to receive Letters.

                  <pb n="599" facs="tcp:204354:342"/> two schismatical Presbyters of the Church of <hi>Carthage;</hi> yet they thought it the duty of every Bishop, and the most effectual way to preserve Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Communion, not only to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern their Churches with the advice and consent of neighbour Bishops of the same Province, but to consult with foreign Churches, especially in matters of such importance, as did equally concern all Churches. And therefore the Clergy of <hi>Rome</hi> after the death of <hi>Fabianus</hi> before they had a new Bishop ordained in his room, in that very Letter to St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> wherein they mightily commend his modesty in acquainting them with the affairs of his Church, and making them, not judges but partners of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, yet acknowledge, that all such publick matters should be concluded by publick advice, and that no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree can be firm and lasting, which has not a general consent: and thus St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> had acknowledged in his <note place="margin">Ep. 1.</note> Letter to them, that mutual love and charity, and the reason of the thing required, that he should not conceal any thing from their notice, but that
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:204354:343"/> they should advise with each other concerning the most profitable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of Ecclesiastical Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. <note place="margin">Ep. 29.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And thus by communicating coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels with each other though they could not meet together in a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council, yet they had the advice and consent of all Christian Churches in the world in all difficult affairs; Neighbour Bishops first advising with each other in provincial Synods, and sending their decrees to other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches for their concurrence with them: and such decrees confirmed by an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal consent, St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> calls the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees <note place="margin">Maximè cùm jam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pridem nobiscum, &amp; cum omnibus omnino episcopis in toto mundo constitutis, etiam Cornelius collega noster—decreverit—<hi>Ep.</hi> 68.</note> of the whole world, and indeed did better serve the ends of Catholick Communion than any general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil did.</p>
               <p>And thus I doubt not, but a late learned Author has given a very true account of the unity of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church according to ancient pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, when he tells us. <hi>The peace of the Church was preserved by communion
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:204354:343"/> of all parts together, not by the subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the rest to one part:</hi> though I do not think he has made a true repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of it, when he saies, <hi>That the case of Bishops was like to that of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">D. <hi>Barrow,</hi> Unity of the Chur. <hi>p.</hi> 30.</note>
                  <hi>Princes, each of whom hath a free su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendence in his own territory, but to uphold justice and peace in the world, or between adjacent Nations, the intercourse of several Princes is needful.</hi> For this makes Christian Communion as arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary a thing, as the confederacies of Princes; whereas the Episcopal Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is but one, and therefore ought to be administred by the mutual advice and consent of Bishops, who all equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly share in it. And Catholick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion is essential to the unity of the Church, and he who violates it by an unreasonable dissent, whatever he be, is a Schismatick, and therefore no member of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick <note place="margin">Qui ergò nec unitatem spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, nec conjunctionem pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis observat, &amp; se ab Ecclesiae vinculo, &amp; à Sacerdotum col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legio separat, Episcopi nec potestatem habere potest nec honorem. <hi>Cypr. Ep. ad An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.</hi> 52.</note> Church; and St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> tells us that such cannot retain ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the power or the honour of a Bishop. The Christian Church is governed by the Episcopal Colledge,
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:204354:344"/> wherein every Bishop has equal pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but yet is by his Office obliged, as far as it is possible to govern his own Church by the advice and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of his Collegues, where there is need of it, and where it can be had; which is a very different thing from the arbitrary combinations of secular Princes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Of the same nature were those Letters of recommendation granted to Presbyters or private Christians (who had occasion to travel) from those Churches of which they were mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, to other Churches, whither they went, which were called formed or communicatory Letters: the design of which was to satisfie foreign Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that those persons who brought such Letters were in communion with the Church which sent them; and therefore to desire them to admit them to their communion, and to show them such respect and kindness, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Christian Brethren, while they stayed with them: for the ancient dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline was very severe in admitting strangers, who were unknown to them, to communion, lest they should
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:204354:344"/> admit Hereticks, or Schismaticks, or Excommunicated persons: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if any such came, who could not produce their recommendatory Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but pretended to have lost them by the way, they were neither admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to communion, nor wholly refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, but if occasion were, maintained by the Church, till such Letters could be procured from the Church from whence they came, which was called the <hi>communio peregrina,</hi> as <hi>Albaspinus</hi> has observed.</p>
               <p>And this was a plain argument of communion between those Churches, who sent, and who received such Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that they would recommend and receive each others members to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and by such Letters <hi>Optatus</hi> tells us <note place="margin">Cum quo nobis totus orbis commercio formatarum in una communionis societate concordat. <hi>Optatus l.</hi> 2.</note> Catholick Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was maintained So much is that Learned man mistaken, who makes this no more, than as Princes <hi>sometimes recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Barrow. Ib. p. 40.</note>
                  <hi>their Subjects to other Princes; they expect offices of humanity toward their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, travelling or trading any where in the world; common reason doth require such
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:204354:345"/> things, but may common union of polity from hence be inferred?</hi> I answer, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Communion may, that all the Churches in the world were uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in one body, and one communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for they were received into all the rights and priviledges of Christian Communion in the Church whither they went, by being owned members of the Church from whence they came: which cannot be said of the subjects of <hi>England</hi> when they travel into <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> though recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by their Princes Letters, which may procure them civil treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but not make them free Deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. There was no other distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the ancient Church between oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casional and fixed communion (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> calls it) but occasional or fixed residence: every Christian was as much a member of every Church, while he was there, as those who were constant Inhabitants, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed constant communion in that Church.</p>
               <p>And if it might not be thought im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modest to pass a censure upon so great, and so deservedly admired a man, I
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:204354:345"/> should venture to say, that he was so much bent upon opposing that noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Church Unity, which set up a supreme and sovereign power over the Catholick Church, such a consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutive Regent Head, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> would have over a National Church (which he has effectually done beyond all contradiction) that he was not so careful to avoid some expressions, which might seem to reflect upon Catholick Communion. He has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a true and perfect account, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the unity of the ancient Church consisted, but to avoid a sovereign Church Power, has made Catholick Communion (which is the only ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Catholick Unity, and the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foundation of Ecclesiastical Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline) too arbitrary a thing, like the confederacies of Sovereign Princes. Not that I suspect so great a man, was either ignorant or unsensible of the necessary obligations to Catholick Communion, but that not being the subject of the present Dispute, he did less attend to the due stating that side of the question.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="606" facs="tcp:204354:346"/>2. After this I need say little to that Communion which was main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained between distant Churches, and private Christians, who were mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of such Churches, which was to own each other as Sister Churches, and actually to communicate with one another, as occasion and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity offered.</p>
               <p>II. Let us now briefly consider, what place there can be for Catholick Communion in this broken and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded state of the Church, which we see at this day: I confess the divisions of Christendom are matter of very sad lamentation, the Church being now so shattered and torn, that we cannot find any one entire commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, in a National, much less in the Universal Church.</p>
               <p>But yet I take that man to be a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Christian, not who communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates with all Sects and Parties of Christians (which is Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s notion of a Catholick Christian) but he who preserves the Communion of the Church wherein he lives; and is ready as occasion shall offer to communicate
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:204354:346"/> with all Christian Churches, which are neither Schismatical nor Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. By Schismatical, I mean those Churches, which separate from the National Church, wherein they live, without just and necessary reason, which can be nothing less than sinful terms of Communion; and by Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, those which impose any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine as the terms of communion, which contradicts some plain and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Article of Faith. It cannot be expected from me, that I should par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly apply this general rule to the various communions of foreign Churches, since my present argument confines me to home; it may suffice for my present purpose, to have given this short and general account of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Communion.</p>

               <head>The Conclusion.</head>
               <p>THus I have as briefly as I could, explained the true nature of Christian Union, and therein answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all those pleas for separation, which relate to the constitution of our Church; and have occasionally taken notice of several others: For though our Adversaries talk loud of sinful terms of communion, yet they are willing, if they can, to shelter themselves in some more obscure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies, of which the people are least capable of judging, but will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily believe upon their authority to be a sufficient reason for their separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or else they cast such mists be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mens eyes by wild and perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed descriptions of Schism, which dwindle it into nothing, or make it a very innocent and harmless thing, that they cannot discover either what it is, or what is the evil or danger of
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:204354:347"/> it: and therefore my great design in this undertaking has been to cut off all these retreats, and so to state the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christian Unity, that every man may understand what Schism is, and be made sensible how inconsistent it is with the true principles of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, and how destructive to mens souls.</p>
               <p>As for the terms of our communion (where the controversie must at last rest, if what I have now discoursed hold true) they have been so often and so learnedly defended, and so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle occasion given by any late assault for a fresh defence, that, I thought, I should do very good service by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cause to that issue again, though I there left it as I found it; and yet in my answer to Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s search for the English Schismatick, I have briefly considered what he has objected against our communion, which I hear also is lately done by another hand, in answer to the <hi>Melius Inquirendum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I shall conclude all with this one observation, how vain all those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of union are, which will not unite Christians in one communion;
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:204354:348"/> they may possibly for a time prevent cutting of throats, but cannot heal the Schisms of the Christian Church; and what little reason we have ever to expect an union with men of Dr. <hi>Owens</hi> principles, who will not <note place="margin">
